            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE STATE OF CHURCH AFFAIRS IN THIS ISLAND UNDER THE Romans and Britiſh KINGS Before the Coming of St. AUGUSTINE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Britains,</hi> who were the firſt known Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this Iſland, were led blind-fold by their blind Guides the <hi>Druides</hi> into the moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Idolatry, and by Them inſtructed in Rites and Ceremonies moſt horribly Impious and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane, ſo as this Iſland at that time might be truly eſteem'd the School and Nurſery of Deviliſh and Barbarous Myſteries, and the miſerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants no other then Bond-ſlaves and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to <hi>Satan,</hi> the common enemy of mankind. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> firſt diſcover'd this our Iſland to the more Civiliz'd World, and made ſome little Entrance into it, for the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquering <hi>Romans</hi> to proceed by Degrees in the more ample Conqueſt of it. It was indeed a Happy Conqueſt to thoſe wretched <hi>Britains,</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning their Redemption from the Bondage of the Devil, and bringing in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96414:3"/>ſo great Knowledge and illuſtrious Light amongſt them, that this our Iſland ſoon became the School of True Religion and Virtue, the Nurſery of Saints, and Refuge of Perſecuted Chriſtians. This Entrance of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s was before the Birth of our Bleſſed Saviour, which happened not until the 43d. year of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> when <hi>Cunobelin</hi> is ſaid to Reign, who is likewiſe ſaid to be the Son of <hi>Caſſibelaun,</hi> whoſe Seat was <hi>Camolodunum,</hi> now <hi>Maldon</hi> in <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> made little advantage of this beginning of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, until the time of the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> who by <hi>Aulus Plantius</hi> his General, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded this Iſland with a great Army, and ſoon after in his own Perſon, and by his ſaid General proſecuted the War more vigorouſly; Inſomuch, as not long after, <hi>Caractacus,</hi> a Prince Renown'd amongſt the <hi>Britains,</hi> being perfidiouſly yet betray'd by ſome of them, was with his Wife and Daughter ſent Priſoners to <hi>Rome,</hi> where his Noble and Generous Carriage was ſuch, as procur'd wonder from his Spectaters, and obtain'd Favour, Reſpect and Compaſſion from the Emperour: By this time, through the diſſention of the <hi>Britains,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> got good footing in this Iſland, but met with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall check from <hi>Boadicea</hi> a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Queen, whom they provok'd by their Cruelty and Avarice; who yet was at laſt cruſh'd by the Invincible Power of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What little glimmering of Learning or Knowledge the <hi>Britains</hi> in thoſe days had, dropt only from the Lips of their <hi>Druids</hi> and <hi>Bards,</hi> they were Prieſts and Prophets to that be-wildred People; by Them they were taught what Deities to Worſhip, and with what execrable Rites, they were to Worſhip them: Their Principal Gods were <hi>Belinus, Baal</hi> or <hi>Bel; Diana</hi> or the <hi>Moon; Camulus</hi> or <hi>Mars; Andate,</hi> or <hi>Adraſte,</hi> whom <hi>Boadicea</hi> is Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have invok'd, when her laſt Battle was ſhaken by the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces, with a number more of petty Dieties, which the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (the very Fountain of Theology) never thought of; and yet <hi>Caractacus</hi> before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, in gratitude for his releaſe from Captivity, and Reſtitution to his Throne, conſecrated a new Altar to his Royal Benefactor the Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he erected in <hi>Cama'odunum,</hi> with this Inſcription, <hi>The Altar of Eternal Domination,</hi> and might indeed have greater Obligations to this his Mortal Deity, then to any of his Antient (Falſly) called Gods, which he and the reſt of the <hi>Britains</hi> had ſo long Ador'd with Unmanly and Slaviſh Superſtition, as they were directed by their blind Prieſts and <hi>Druides;</hi> For, they order'd both publick and private Sacrifices, they diſpens'd Rewards and Puniſhments, determin'd all Controverſies; and who ever refus'd to obey their Decrees, were forbidden to be preſent at the Sacrifices, and conſequently were avoided and abandon'd, as moſt Impious and deteſtable perſons.</p>
            <p>Moſt of their Rites and Ceremonies were vain and fooliſh, ſuch as they uſed in gathering of <hi>Miſtletoe</hi> from the <hi>Oak,</hi> to which they aſcrib'd great Virtue, but many of them Barbarous and Excerable; by which to Divine of future Events they would make their Altars flow with Humane Blood, and conſult their Cruel Gods by ſearching into Entrails of Innocent Men; Inſomuch as <hi>Claudius</hi> himſelf, (though a <hi>Heathen,</hi>) thought fit by rigorous Edicts to Interdict this Execrable Religion to his <hi>Romans,</hi> but could not weed it out of the Hearts of the Beſotted <hi>Britains.</hi> But what the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours could not effect, the Power of Almighty God ſoon brought to paſs, ſending a new <hi>Caeleſtial</hi> Light to diſſipate that more than <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkneſs, wherein this our Country had been ſo long involv'd.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96414:3"/>
            <p>This our Iſland, (though divided from the reſt of the World,) yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the bright Beams of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> to dawn in it, ſooner then many other Countries nearer approaching to that place where this ever Bleſſed <hi>Sun</hi> aroſe. If we may believe our Antient <hi>Gildas, This day Star ſprung from on high, viſited us ſoon after the Aſſenſion of our Saviour, toward the end of the Reign of</hi> Tiberius Caeſar; by which this Antient Hiſtorian might mean, at leaſt, that about that time many zealous Apoſtolical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were then in preparation for their Journey into <hi>Britain,</hi> though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it might be before they could arrive hither; The Atteſtation of other Credible Writers to this of our <hi>Gildas,</hi> may induce us to believe without any violence to our Reaſon, that the Zeal of ſome Primitive Chriſtians might very early carry them as far as this our Country, to divulge the Bleſſed Tidings of Salvation, then forthwith to be Preach'd indifferently to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and likely to be moſt welcom to them; Two great advantages theſe forward Miſſioners had for their Entrance into this Iſland, to which a way was open'd bythe <hi>Roman</hi> Conqueſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The coming of St. <hi>Peter</hi> at that time from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The being of <hi>Caractacus</hi> with his Queen, Brethren and Family, and conſequently a multitude of Attendants then at <hi>Rome.</hi> The former is atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Euſebius</hi> and others, with the intent of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s coming thither, in purſuit of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and to take his Apoſtolical Chair in the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis and principal City of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, from whence the Chriſtian Doctrine might be the more eaſily diſpers'd over the whole World. The latter is confirm'd by Learn'd Writers, and in particular that a Noble <hi>Britiſh</hi> Virgin, either Attendant to <hi>Caractacus,</hi> (or as ſome ſay, his Daughter,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Diſciple to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and by her Virtue and Chriſtian Piety, prov'd a more Illuſtrious Ornament to our Country, than <hi>Caractacus</hi> himſelf by his Heroick Magnanimity; This Lady, it may ſeem, after Married <hi>Rufus</hi> a Noble <hi>Roman,</hi> and chang'd her <hi>Britiſh</hi> Name into <hi>Claudia Ruffina</hi> after the <hi>Roman</hi> Dialect, and was the ſame which <hi>Martial</hi> ſo highly Celebrates in a ſhort <hi>Epithalamium</hi> upon her Marriage, with one he calls <hi>Pudens,</hi> who by Tradition, is ſaid to have Entertain'd St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his Houſe, which was after erected into a Church: True it is, St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his 2d. Epiſtle to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> ſent to him from <hi>Rome,</hi> (amongſt other Salutations,) joynes <hi>Pudens</hi> and <hi>Claudia.</hi> And a late Learned Writer hath demonſtrated out of Antiquity, that this our <hi>Claudia Ruffina</hi> ſprang from the Royal Blood of <hi>Britain,</hi> and was the Wife and Mother of Glorious Saints. And our Antient Hiſtories report that <hi>Timotheus</hi> the Eldeſt Son of <hi>Pudens,</hi> came into this our Iſland, and Converted many to the Faith, and at leaſt diſpos'd King <hi>Lucius</hi> to his ſucceeding Converſion; And the reaſon of ſuch his coming hither might be, the Love and regard he had to his Mother a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Lady.</p>
            <p>It is pretended that <hi>Pomponia Graecina</hi> the Wife of <hi>Plantius</hi> General of the Army under <hi>Claudius</hi> in this Iſland, was a Chriſtian and Devout Saint; but this may be doubtful, though it be clear by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that ſhe was Accus'd of a ſtrange Religion forbidden by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, which might be the Chriſtian Religion, to the knowledge whereof ſhe might attain by her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with <hi>Claudia Ruffina.</hi> But we have more unqueſtionable Records of one <hi>Manſuetus,</hi> Companion of St. <hi>Clemens,</hi> which <hi>Manſuetus</hi> was a <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Britain,</hi> who went to <hi>Rome</hi> either with <hi>Adminius,</hi> a Prince of <hi>Britain,</hi> or <hi>Bericus</hi> a Nobleman thereof, or as Attendant upon <hi>Caractacus,</hi> where the ſaid <hi>Manſuetus</hi> might be Converted by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and be by him conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96414:4"/>Biſhop of <hi>Toul</hi> in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> upon a Miracle by him done, in reſtoring to Life and Health a Son of the Governour of that City, whoſe ſaid Son fell down from a high <hi>Tower;</hi> the effect of which Miracle was the Converſion of the ſaid Governour, his whole Family, and a great number of his Citizens; Inſomuch, as after the word had a free courſe, not only in that City, but in the Country thereabouts, Prieſts were Ordain'd, and a Church erected, and Conſecrated to the <hi>Holy Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time, one <hi>Beatus</hi> of this <hi>Iſland,</hi> was converted to the Chriſtian Faith, and went to <hi>Rome</hi> for further inſtruction therein by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and after became the Apoſtle of the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> and dy'd amongſt them, illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for his exemplary Piety, and great Miracles.</p>
            <p>Thus early did it pleaſe God to enlighten this our native Country with his Divine Truth, and to transform the Barbarous Inhabitants thereof into Apoſtles, and Meſſengers of Salvation to other Countries alſo. And as it appears by antient Monuments, it pleas'd our good God to ſend his Prime Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter</hi> into this <hi>Iſland,</hi> to eſtabliſh and confirm what other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (though of great Honour and Holineſs) had begun, yet for want of the Epiſcopal Character could not eſtabliſh Order and Government in this new planted Church, as the Apoſtles could, and did do.</p>
            <p>Unqueſtionable antient Authors have Recorded, that when the World was divided by Lott amongſt the Apoſtles; the <hi>West</hi> became the Portion of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and that from <hi>Rome</hi> he came to <hi>Britain,</hi> and made a long abode there, conſtituting Churches, and ordaining Prieſts and Deacons; this Truth has been confirm'd by many Holy and Primitive <hi>Popes,</hi> by many of our <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, by the Viſion of S. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsor;</hi> Nay, our late King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt of ever Bleſſed Memory, did not doubt in a publick Audience, to affirm, that <hi>Rome</hi> was the Mother of all Churches. In what particular year this coming of S. <hi>Peter</hi> was, is not eaſie to determine; whether upon the Emperour <hi>Claudius</hi>'s Edict to Baniſh all <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> or in the beginning of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign, is doubtful; But that he was abſent from <hi>Rome</hi> when S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> is more than probable, ſince he omitted S. <hi>Peter</hi> out of his Salutations. Certainly, a freer ſcope was allow'd in this <hi>Iſland</hi> at that time for Divine Verities, than in other places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe <hi>Nero</hi>'s Perſecution never extended hither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For that the power of the <hi>Romans</hi> here was a little limited by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Princes, who were at leaſt civil to Chriſtians.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The great diſtance betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and this <hi>Iſland,</hi> as may appear by the quiet and un-interupted ſolitude of <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> where was erected the firſt School of Contemplation, and which continu'd the glorious Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a World of Saints, even to late years.</p>
            <p>It may be found in a very antient Author, who Writes of Church Affairs, in the firſt Century, that he mentions the exaltation of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church under <hi>Nero,</hi> adding that many Churches were built in this <hi>Iſland</hi> by S. <hi>Peter;</hi> and it is agreed of on all hands, that the cruelty of <hi>Nero</hi> towards the Chriſtians, drove S. <hi>Paul</hi> out of <hi>Rome,</hi> even as far <hi>Westward</hi> as <hi>Britain,</hi> where, though he was had in high Veneration, yet we never read that the Church here planted was called the Seat of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but often the Chair of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> Inſomuch as <hi>Gildas</hi> inveighing againſt ſome of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Clergy in his time, tells them, <hi>They uſurp'd the Chair of St.</hi> Peter <hi>with impure feet;</hi> Thereby intimating that the whole Eccleſiaſtical Order here, receiv'd their Original
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96414:4"/>Prieſthood by a right Succeſſion from St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Howbeit our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrology deſervedly reckons St. <hi>Paul</hi> among the Apoſtles of <hi>Britain:</hi> And ſo was <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> alſo, one of the 70 Diſciples, and a Follower of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd a Biſhop here, and here alſo dy'd a Martyr in the ſecond year of <hi>Nero,</hi> or at leaſt a Confeſſor in his very Old Age, after he had ſpent ſome time in Solitude at <hi>Glastonbury,</hi> the common Retiring place of many Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saints. It was certainly meant by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> when he Salutes the Houſhold of <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> omitting him, being then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in this Country, or in his Journey towards it.</p>
            <p>This progreſs had the Goſpel in this Iſland before the Death of St. <hi>Peter</hi> or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and was mightily advanc'd by the coming of <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea</hi> and his Companions, about the end of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign, making up the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Twelve Perſons with himſelf, one of which Twelve is ſaid to be his Son of his own Name: The coming and Preaching of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions hath been publickly alledg'd in ſeveral General Councels by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Orators, as an Argument of Precedence in thoſe Councels, taken from the early approach of the Goſpel to this Nation; and further affirm'd by other Antient Records, and eſpecially by that Illuſtrious Charter of King <hi>Henry</hi> the II. to the Abbey of <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> ſignifying his intention to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build that <hi>Monaſtery,</hi> not long before Conſum'd by Fire; and to renew all the Priviledges confer'd on it by his Predeceſſors King <hi>William</hi> the I. and II. and by more Ancient Kings St. <hi>Edgar</hi> the Father of St. <hi>Edward,</hi> King <hi>Edmond</hi> and his Father, <hi>Edward</hi> and his Grand-father <hi>Alfred,</hi> by King <hi>Brithwald, Hentwyn, Baldred, Ina,</hi> the famous King <hi>Arthur, Cantred</hi> and many other Chriſtian Kings; and even by <hi>Kenwalla</hi> a <hi>Pagan</hi> King of <hi>Britain:</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affirming, that he the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> the II. caus'd a diligent Inquiſition to be made of the ſaid Charters and Priviledges, which were preſented and Read in his Preſence, all which he Confirm'd and Renew'd to the ſame Church, antiently ſtil'd, <hi>The Mother and Tomb of Saints,</hi> becauſe it had been Built by the immediate Diſciples of our Lord, and to him Dedicated, as Venerable Antiquity doth teſtifie: All which conſider'd, to deny ſo great a Bleſſing confer'd on our Nation, muſt ſavour of Paſſion and un-excuſable Partiality.</p>
            <p>The time and occaſion of St. <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Arrival here, and the particular Acts of him and his Companions, after ſo many years of change and alteration, cannot befully accountable: The time in all likelihood, was when <hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> was Pretor here, and when <hi>Policletus</hi> Favourite to <hi>Nero</hi> came hither with his Retinue; the occaſion of his coming is leſs certain; Some write that St. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſent hither by St. <hi>Philip</hi> the Apoſtle or Evangeliſt, grounding their opinion from <hi>Procalphius</hi> who ſpeaks little to that purpoſe: Tradition informs us, that St. <hi>Joſeph</hi> at his firſt coming Addreſs'd himſelf to <hi>Arviragus,</hi> then King of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and ſaid to be the Founder of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> by the help of an <hi>Augur</hi> or Prophet named <hi>Olenus Calenus,</hi> from whom it was firſt called <hi>Calena:</hi> And although <hi>Arviragus</hi> did not ſubmit to the Doctrine of St. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> yet he gave him leave to publiſh it in Peace; ſo well was he prepar'd to the Entertainment of Divine Truth, by humane Education: Nay, he was alſo pleas'd to afford <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Companions a place of Retreat, not only commodious for their Devotions, but ſufficient for their Suſtenance; call'd by the <hi>Britains</hi> the <hi>Glaſsey-Iſland,</hi> or <hi>Avallonia,</hi> in which certain Lands were alloted, both by <hi>Arviragus</hi> and his Son <hi>Marius,</hi> containing about 12 Hydes for the Nouriſhment of thoſe Godly perſons; being the firſt of ground in this Iſland Dedicated to the Service of God, and after called <hi>Godney.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:96414:5"/>
            <p>The firſt thing theſe new Inhabitants undertook, was to build and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate a Church for the Worſhip of God; which they Dedicated to the Honour of the moſt Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> And as is affirm'd amongſt other things relating to <hi>Glaſtonbury</hi> Monaſtery, in an Epiſtle of St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> who died there, was Conſecrated Miraculouſly by our Bleſſed Lord himſelf, to the Honour of his Mother: This wonderful Conſecration is more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd by the Teſtimony of the Illuſtrious Biſhop of St. <hi>David,</hi> the Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pator of <hi>Pelagianiſme</hi> out of <hi>Britain;</hi> as hath been Collected out of the Antiquities of <hi>Glaſtonbury</hi> by <hi>Williàm</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> to this effect following. <hi>That St.</hi> David <hi>with other Biſhops coming to</hi> Glaſtonbury, <hi>invited by the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the place; reſolv'd to Conſecrate the Church there, formerly erected to the Honour of the Mother of God; and having provided all things neceſſary for that purpoſe, the night before his intended Ceremony; our Bleſſed Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to St.</hi> David <hi>in his ſleep, and demanded the cauſe of his coming thither, which St.</hi> David <hi>forthwith declar'd; whereupon our Lord taking him by the Hand, told him, That he himſelf many years before had Dedicated the ſaid Church to the Honour of his Mother, and that That Holy Ceremony was not to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fain'd by any mans repeating: And having ſaid this, with his Finger pierc'd through the Biſhops Hand; telling him this ſhould be a ſign, that what himſelf had formerly Anticipated, ought not again to be Renew'd; and withall promis'd him, that when the ſaid Biſhop the next day at the</hi> Canon of the Maſs <hi>ſhould pronounce the words,</hi> Per ipſum, &amp; cum ipſo, &amp; in ipſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>His Hand ſhould be reſtor'd ſound to him: The Biſhop awaking, found his Hand pierc'd; and others ſaw and touch'd the Wound with great Admiration; and the Preparation for the</hi> Conſecration <hi>was laid aſide; and during the Celebration of</hi> Maſs, <hi>the Biſhops Hand became Sound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſum of what hath hitherto been here related, is repeated by St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> the Convertor of our Nation in an Epiſtle of his to St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, and by <hi>Copgrave</hi> in the Life of St. <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and is further teſtify'd by an Antient Inſcription cut in <hi>Braſs,</hi> faſten'd to a Pillar in the ſame Church, declaring in effect what hath been ſaid already: This Inſcription is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> in his <hi>Collection of Councels,</hi> and yet by him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be Fabulous.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>He doubts whether any Chriſtian Churches were Erected ſo early.</hi> Which doubt is certainly groundleſs, unleſs he mean ſuch Magnificent Structures as have been built ſince Chriſtianity hath been publickly cheriſh'd and countenanc'd; but that even under the Harrows of Perſecution the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians made ſhift to Erect or Aſſign places to meet in, and perform the Rites and Duties of Religion, is Atteſted by all Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>If Churches were Built, yet they were not Encompaſs'd with ground for Burial before St.</hi> Cuthbert<hi>'s time; Burial within Cities being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the</hi> Roman <hi>Laws.</hi> Sure this is a falſe conceit, for King <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> and his Biſhop St. <hi>Augustine</hi> before St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi>'s days, were Buried in the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Canterbury. Conſtantine</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Emperour, was buried amongſt the Relicks and Bones of the Apoſtles and Martyrs: And as for the <hi>Roman</hi> Law forbidding Burials in Cities, it was antiquated long before this; however <hi>Glaſtonbury</hi> was no City, ſcarce a Village, rather a Deſart far from <hi>Rome,</hi> and under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Princes, well-wiſhers to Chriſtianity, and the ſimplicity thereof in thoſe days.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:96414:5"/>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Dedication of Churches was not then in uſe:</hi> Doubtleſs many Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Solemnities have been added by the Church, but as certainly the Houſes, or Places which the moſt Primitive Chriſtians aſſigned for the Worſhip of God, were by ſome Ceremonies Dedicated to that uſe; as by erecting a Title, fixing a Croſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the moſt antient Records teſtifie.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, That which moſt diſpleaſes Sir <hi>Hen.</hi> is the Dedication of this Church to the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> for he thinks ſuch a kind of Devotion, was not thought of until many Ages after; but then he muſt forget the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Spain,</hi> atteſted in all their <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and many of their Councils, that from the firſt entrance of Chriſtianity into that Kingdom, ſeveral Churches have been erected to the Honour of that Bleſſed <hi>Virgin;</hi> witneſs that moſt Famous Temple at <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> called <hi>Dell Pilar,</hi> Celebrated above 1000 years ſince, by St. <hi>Maximus</hi> Biſhop of that City, in ſeveral <hi>Hymns</hi> by him compoſed, in Honour of that Venerable Houſe, called <hi>Angelical,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Pillar on which the <hi>Virgins</hi> Statue was fixed, is thought to be brought thither by the Miniſtery of Angels.</p>
            <p>After the Death of <hi>Arviragus, Marius</hi> his Son ſucceeds him in the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Throne, reſembling his Father, as in Courage, and other Prince-like Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; ſo alſo in his kindneſs to theſe holy Strangers. This <hi>Marius</hi> is reported to have had a great Victory over the <hi>Picts,</hi> who were doubtleſly no other than the <hi>Northern Britains</hi> then unconquered, and conſequently unciviliz'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> but who remaining in their Barbarous cuſtom of painting their Bodies, got a new name of <hi>Picts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Death of this <hi>Marius,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Coilus</hi> his Son, our St. <hi>Joſeph</hi> is ſaid to end his Labours and Mortality, in the 82 of our Lord, and ſecond year of the Reign of the Emperour <hi>Titus.</hi> After the Death of <hi>Nero,</hi> Cruel to himſelf, his own Mother, the poor Chriſtians, and indeed to all Mankind, and the barbarous extinguiſher of thoſe two moſt Glorious Lights then ſhining in the World St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul;</hi> the Family of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> failing, four Emperours were ſet up and pulled down within the ſpace of two years, <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> only excepted, who becoming Conquerour, at laſt ſettled the Empire and reſtored Peace; The <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi> were unconcern'd in theſe Broils, and were well affected to <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> who by his Deputy <hi>Frontinus,</hi> placed a Legion in <hi>Caerleon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Joſeph</hi> after a Solitary Life led at <hi>Glastonbury,</hi> where he ſeems to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a Monaſtical Profeſſion with his ſaid Companions, and ſuch other Holy Perſons as his and their Labours had Converted to the Faith, Died their about the ſaid 82 year of our Lords Incarnation, and was Buried at <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> as his Companions alſo were, in or near the Church Built by him; where ſince innumerable Converts and Chriſtians have been Interred: It is thought the Body of this Renowned Saint was depoſited in a Cave, over which a Chappel was after Built to his Honour, as this <hi>Epitaph</hi> there found imports.</p>

            <p>His Reliques not having been diſcover'd, ſome Devout perſons in the days of <hi>Edward</hi> the III. obtain'd leave to ſearch for them: The Patent for that purpoſe is yet extant to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That a ſupplication having been made by</hi> John Blome <hi>of</hi> London, <hi>wherein he affirms, that he had received a command from Heaven, diligently to ſeek till
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96414:6"/>he could find the Body of the Noble Councellor</hi> Joſeph of Arimathaea, <hi>which repoſes in Chriſt within the limits of</hi> Glaſtonbury Monaſtery, <hi>and which for the Saints Honour was to be diſcover'd in thoſe times. And for that it appear'd by Antient Records that his Body was there buried: The ſaid King, if ſo, deſirous to bestow due Honours to the Monument and Venerable Reliques of him, who expreſt ſo great Piety and Charity to our dying Redeemer, that he took his Body from the Croſs, and plac'd it ina New Monument which he had built for himſelf, and hoping that by the revealing of his Holy Reliques greater Grace and Favour ſhould be ſhew'd by God to him and his Kingdom; did give and grant permiſſion, as much as in him lay, to the ſaid</hi> John Blome <hi>to dig where he ſhould find it expedient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the precincts of the ſaid Monastery, in order to the ſearching out of the ſaid precious Reliques, according to the Injunction and Revelation made unto him, provided he did it with the conſent of the Abbot, and without prejudice to the Monaſtery.</hi> What was found upon this ſearch doth not appear, but the Piety and Devotion of the King may be eaſily collected.</p>
            <p>The ſame Monuments which inform us of the Life, Death and Burial of St. <hi>Joſeph</hi> at <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> as an unqueſtionable Tradition in all Ages, agreed unto by <hi>Britains, Saxons, Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans;</hi> do likewiſe teſtifie, <hi>That he brought with him into</hi> Britain <hi>two Silver Veſſels fill'd with the Blood of our Saviour Christ, which were buried with him in his Tomb;</hi> Several Proofs hereof were extant even to the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> amongſt others the Narration of <hi>William Good</hi> a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> who was born in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. and bred up in his Childhood at <hi>Glastonbury,</hi> and affirms, <hi>That in his time certain Braſs-plates were Engraven to perpetuate the memory of theſe things, as alſo Chappels, Grots, Croſses, Arms, and the obſervation of the Feſtival of St.</hi> Joſeph <hi>on the ſixth of the</hi> Calends <hi>of</hi> Auguſt, <hi>which remain'd as long as the</hi> Monks <hi>enjoy'd the Charters of their Munificent and Royal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, but are now buried in the ruines of the place.</hi> He confeſſeth, <hi>never any</hi> Monk <hi>knew the certain place of this Saints Sepulcher: The common report was, it was extreamly deep under ground, ſomewhere in or about</hi> Hambden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill; <hi>but when ever the Saints Body ſhall be found, multitudes would reſort to it, invited with the great and innumerable Miracles which ſhould be there wrought: He remembers, to have ſeen upon a Stone-Croſs, which was demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in Queen</hi> Elizabeth's <hi>days, a Plate of</hi> Braſs, <hi>on which was written: That in the</hi> 30th. <hi>year after the Paſſion of our Lord,</hi> Joſeph of Arimathaea <hi>with</hi> 11 <hi>or</hi> 12 <hi>Companions came into</hi> Britain, <hi>and were permitted by King</hi> Arvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagus <hi>to abide at</hi> Glaſton <hi>then called</hi> Avallonia, <hi>like Solitary men; and that he brought with him two ſmall Silver Veſſels of the Sacred Blood and Water which flow'd out of Christ's ſide after his death. And that a Croſs was there Erected many years before, to ſhew the length of the Chappel which St.</hi> Joſeph <hi>built of wailed Roddes of the most Holy Virgin, on the out-ſide of the Wall of which Chappel were Engraven in Antient Characters</hi> JESUS MARIA.</p>
            <p>There were then other Remarks and Footſteps of theſe Truths to be there found: Now that St. <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> alſo, with due veneration ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd the Blood of our Lord, which for many Ages was Piouſly Worſhiped by Devout Chriſtians both in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> is teſtified by divers An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Hiſtories and Martyrologies; and to this purpoſe it is remarkable what <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> hath related in the year of our Lord God 1247. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That then the Master of the Temple and Hoſpital of St.</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſent a certain portion of the Blood of our Lord ſhed upon the Croſs, in a most Beautiful Christal Glaſs, by a Brother of the Temple; which Preſent was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96414:6"/>by the then Patriarch of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, and other Prelates and Noblemen then dwelling in the</hi> Holy-Land: The ſaid Hiſtorian further declaring at large, <hi>With what Honour and Reverence this Holy Treaſure was entertain'd by King</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> III. <hi>and his whole Clergy and Nobility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And at the ſame time (to give ſatisfaction to doubting Minds,) <hi>Robert Groſthead</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> the Glory of that Age for Piety and Learning, affords us a large Narration of the Fact, to the effect following: <hi>That</hi> Joſeph of Arimathaea <hi>a Noble Councellour, and one of the Hearers of Jeſus, or his Diſciple rather, out of tender compaſſion, was very ſollicitous how his venerable Body might be preſerv'd from the rage of the</hi> Jews; <hi>Howbeit, both He and</hi> Nicodemus <hi>and other rich men, though moſt cordial Lovers of Jeſus, yet conceal'd their Affection for fear of their Eſtates; Nevertheleſs when Jeſus was Crucify'd,</hi> Joſeph <hi>went boldly to</hi> Pilate <hi>and beg'd the Body of Jeſus, and by</hi> Pilat<hi>'s permiſſion (notwithſtanding the murmuring of the</hi> Jews) <hi>with all due Honour and Reverence took down the moſt Holy Body from the Croſs, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and bloody, and with a fine Linnen-cloath Devoutly and carefully wip'd the Sacred Wounds as yet moiſt and distilling, and having drawn the Nails out of the Wounds he wip'd and cleans'd them at the Croſs, and then carrying the Body from</hi> Golgotha, <hi>he laid it in a new Tomb where never any body had been laid; and which was decently cut out of a Rock, as provided and intended for</hi> Joſeph <hi>himſelf.</hi> But before our Saint would bury the Body, he waſh'd it, for it was cover'd with Blood. Firſt, in regard of his late Bloody-Sweat. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by reaſon of his Cruel Scourging. Thirdly, The preſſing of a Crown of Thorns upon his Head. Fourthly, The Nails in his Hands and Feet. Laſtly, The Souldiers Spear which did not only Wound, but open a wide paſſage into his ſide. <hi>Joſeph</hi> alſo waſh'd this Sacred Body in order to the Embalming of it: <hi>He waſh'd it</hi> (ſaith <hi>Groſthead</hi>) <hi>with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Religions deſign to appropriate the ſame Blood to his own devout uſe, as a moſt precious Treaſure and Medicine for his Soul: The Water tinctur'd with the Blood, he would not cast away, but kept it in a clean Veſſel; and the pure Blood diſtilling from the Wounds of his Hands and Feet, he reſerv'd with more Reverence; But above all, with more then ordinary Devotion and Holy Fear he receiv'd into a most precious Veſſel, the Blood mix'd with Water, which he carefully preſs'd out of his Right ſide; and which he judg'd to iſſue from his Heart; This he eſteem'd a Treaſure invaluable, to be reſerv'd for himſelf and his Succeſſours:</hi> This was the Diſcourſe, and theſe the Sentiments of that Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Prelate, upon the fore-mention'd occaſion.</p>
            <p>It may ſeem ſtrange, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> accounting this Blood ſo ineſtimable a Treaſure, ſhould yet ordain it to be put into the Grave with him, as it is ſaid he did; He may be thought to do it, leaſt in ſuch a time when <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> prevail'd, the Holy Relick might be Profan'd; and if Chriſtianity ever came to be uppermoſt, Devout Chriſtians might know whither to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort for it; or perhaps he might have the ſame deſign with the Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> who carefully collected the Relicks of the Apoſtles, and after they were richly adorn'd, commanded they ſhould be laid up in his Tomb; <hi>To the end</hi> (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us) <hi>that being dead, he might be made partaker of the Prayers, which there in Honour of the Apoſtles ſhould be offer'd unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the death of S. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> S. <hi>Phagan</hi> ſucceeded in the Prefecture of this Holy Place, and continu'd in it about 30 years, and under him and other his Succeſſors, who enjoy'd the Poſſeſſions beſtow'd upon them by the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:96414:7"/>Kings, a Monaſtical Converſation was upheld, until the Reign of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> at which time the publick Preaching of the Goſpel, was not only permitted, but encourag'd: So as theſe Holy men in all likelihood were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, and by Charity compell'd to leave God for God, to forſake their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and imploy their Devotion and Labours in Converting and Saving the Souls of others; by reaſon whereof, it is reported, that this place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Deſolate; Howbeit, not long after, the memory of St. <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſtir'd up Devout Chriſtians, to viſit and enlarge the Church here Dedicated to the Bleſſed Virgin, as the Fountain and Original of Chriſtian Religion in this Iſland.</p>
            <p>A little before the death of St <hi>Joſeph, Julius Agricola</hi> was ſent Pretor into <hi>Britain</hi> in the laſt year of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and was entertain'd with Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Wales,</hi> which with extraordinary diligence he reſiſted, and made his Victory compleat at the Iſle of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> from whence <hi>Paulinus</hi> had lately been re-call'd by the Dreadful Rebellion of the foremention'd unhappy Queen of the <hi>Trinobantes Boadicea. Agricola</hi> after took care to govern the Province in Peace, to reſtrain the Avarice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, to defend the Natives from injuries, and by his Courteſie and Civility in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them to delight in Peace.

            <p>In the third year of his Pretorſhip he March'd <hi>Northward,</hi> and waſted the Country as far as <hi>Tweed,</hi> and the <hi>Summer</hi> following he extended his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts as far as <hi>Bodotria,</hi> now <hi>Edinborough Frith, Eaſtward,</hi> and <hi>Glotta</hi> now the <hi>Frith</hi> of <hi>Dunbritton Weſtward,</hi> and ſtrengthen'd the narrow ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them with Forts and Garriſons: So as the only Enemies remaining unconquer'd, were the <hi>Caledonian Britains,</hi> at a Town thereabouts, now called <hi>Abercurven;</hi> an Antient Structure is at this day extant, all of ſquare Stones, which the inhabitants call <hi>Julius</hi>'s <hi>Hoft,</hi> and fancy to have been built by <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> but more probably was rais'd by this <hi>Julius Agricola,</hi> as a Monument of his Conqueſts.</p>
            <p>In the fifth year of his Expedition, he pierc'd into the <hi>Northweſt</hi> Provinces toward <hi>Ireland,</hi> as if he had an intent to paſs over thither; and indeed he is ſaid to be invited over by a Petty Prince of that Iſland, who compell'd by his Rebellious Subjects thereunto, made ſome Addreſſes unto him.</p>
            <p>The following year he ſpent in a March from <hi>Edinborough Northward,</hi> to ſind out the limits of the Country, the <hi>Romans</hi> as yet not knowing whether <hi>Britain</hi> were an Iſland or not; in which march of his, he caus'd his Navy to keep pace with his Land-Army, both for his Security and Supply, but to the great Terrour of the poor <hi>Britains,</hi> who to free themſelves from this danger, attempted the ninth Legion, ſeparated from the reſt of the common Army, yet were defeated, but after under the Conduct of <hi>Galgacus,</hi> emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent both for Nobility and Courage, reſolv'd to put all to the hazard of a Battle; and aſſembling all their Forces upon the mountain <hi>Grampus,</hi> after a Cruel and Bloody Fight, were entirely Defeated; This Battle was Fought in the laſt year of <hi>Agricola</hi>'s Government: For in the beginning of the year following, which was the 5th. of <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign, he return'd to <hi>Rome;</hi> where (after ſome ſhew of Honour,) he became the object of that Tyrants Envy, and not long after the Sacrifice of his Cruelty.</p>

            <p>In <hi>Trajan</hi>'s time, <hi>Britain</hi> was divided only into two Provinces, call'd the firſt and ſecond, greater and leſs, or the upper and lower <hi>Britain;</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer contain'd the <hi>Southern</hi> part, as far as the <hi>River-Thames,</hi> firſt poſſeſſed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> the latter the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Provinces, as <hi>Cornwal, Wales,</hi> &amp;c. Toward the latter end of <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Reign, ſome of the <hi>Britains</hi> attempted to ſhake off the <hi>Roman</hi> yoak, but were neglected by the Emperour, engag'd in other Affairs of more concern; It is not certain which of the <hi>Britains</hi> made this attempt; <hi>Coelus</hi> is then ſaid to be King of the <hi>Britains,</hi> not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the ſole King, but moſt conſiderable for Power and Wealth, to whom the reſt yielded Honour and ſome kind of Subjection, as ſome of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Princes in former Ages are ſaid to have done to <hi>Caſſibelan;</hi> and as after in the time of the <hi>Heptarchy,</hi> to him who was ſtil'd <hi>Rex Anglorum:</hi> This King <hi>Coelus</hi> is deſcrib'd in Hiſtory, to be a Prince of a Benign and Peaceable Nature, and well affected to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as having been train'd and brought up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them from his tender years, and conſequently not likely to joyn in any Rebellion againſt them. Now though <hi>Trajan</hi> had not leaſure to reduce theſe Tumultuous <hi>Britains,</hi> yet his Succeſſor <hi>Adrian</hi> neglected them not, as may appear by ſeveral Coins, where on are Imprinted the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Army, with three <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, importing the three Legions in <hi>Britain,</hi> viz. the ſecond called <hi>Auguſta,</hi> the fourteenth called <hi>Victrix,</hi> and the twentyth called <hi>Victrix &amp; Britanica;</hi> And this it ſeems was done to admoniſh the <hi>Britains</hi> that this new Emperour was mindful of their Diſorders, which about three years after he came himſelf in perſon to chaſtiſe; <hi>Julius Severus</hi> was now Pretor under <hi>Adrian,</hi> but did little, as to the ſuppreſſing the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults here, eſpecially in the <hi>Southern</hi> parts, where <hi>Coelus</hi> was King. Howbeit <hi>Adrian</hi> in his third year began his Progreſs for the rectifying Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, compoſing Seditions, and reſtoring Diſcipline to his Armies every where; He began with <hi>Germany,</hi> from thence took a view of <hi>France,</hi> and the following year paſs'd over into <hi>Britain,</hi> where his firſt Exploit was, to ſeparate ſuch as Peaceably liv'd in ſubjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, from ſuch as refus'd to ſubmit to its yoak.</p>
            <p>Now whereas the <hi>Northern Britains</hi> ſince they were overthrown by <hi>Agricola,</hi> had broken through the Fortifications he had made in the narrow <hi>Iſthmus</hi> between the <hi>Friths</hi> of <hi>Edenborough</hi> and <hi>Dunbritton;</hi> yet <hi>Adrian</hi> thought not fit to hazard his Army, in repelling them within thoſe former bounds, but contented himſelf to raiſe a Wall or Rampire more <hi>Southerly,</hi> which he continu'd the ſpace of 80 Miles between <hi>Solway-Frith</hi> on the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and <hi>Tinmouth</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> ſide of the Iſle, it was made of Turf, and ſtrengthen'd with Timber; and in after Ages was call'd, <hi>The
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96414:8"/>Picts Wall,</hi> when that <hi>Northern</hi> Nation became to be term'd <hi>Picts,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>The next year <hi>Adrian</hi> was call'd out of <hi>Britain,</hi> to compoſe Sedition rais'd in <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt:</hi> When <hi>Adrian</hi> was near thereabouts, the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were loud in their Complaints againſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine,</hi> from whence that Holy Religion ſprang; the number of them was then great in that Country, by reaſon of the continual reſort of Believers to that Sacred place from every quarter of the World, to celebrate the memory both of our Saviours Actions and Paſſions there: Upon theſe Complaints, he renews the Perſecution began by his Predeceſſor, and imagining that he could deſtroy <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, by a Malicious Defacing the Place where it began, he erected Idols of Devils in the moſt Sacred place of our Lords Paſſion, <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Mount Calvary, Venus</hi> where the <hi>Croſs</hi> had been fix'd, <hi>Adonis</hi> at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> conceiving the memory of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion would be ſoon blotted out by the Worſhip of theſe Idols: And indeed this Holy Place lay in this deſolation, until <hi>Helena</hi> the Mother of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> thought it worth her Pains to ſearch out the Croſs, as is hereafter more fully related.</p>
            <p>The Learning, Patience and Conſtancy of the Chriſtians, through the interceſſion of Noble and Conſiderable Perſons on their behalf, caus'd <hi>Adrian</hi> at laſt to publiſh an Edict, that none ſhould be puniſh'd for their Belief, if free from other Crimes.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of this Emperour's Reign, dy'd our King <hi>Coelus,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for his Succeſſor his Son <hi>Lucius,</hi> a Child of Ten years old, reſembling his Father in Virtue, and conſequently belov'd of his Subjects; his Fathers affection to the <hi>Romans,</hi> procur'd him a <hi>Roman</hi> Name deriv'd from Light, the <hi>Britains</hi> upon the ſame account call'd him <hi>Lever Maur,</hi> or a great Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for the Joy he brought to the whole Kingdom, eſpecially to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being born to him in his Old Age, and 37th. year of his Reign; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this Name foreſhew'd a greater Light of Divine Truth, which in this Princes time, and by his care and procurement, was communicated to the whole Kingdom. This Bleſſing arriv'd not all at once, he did not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quit the Superſtition of his Fore fathers, though he continu'd his Father's Kindneſs to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> his heart was to be prepar'd and cultivated by little and little for the Heavenly Seed, by many Diſpenſations of Providence hereafter occurring.</p>

            <p>Together with <hi>Marcellus,</hi> there came from <hi>Rome</hi> another Illuſtrious Saint, of Noble Birth and Plentiful Fortunes, which yet he relinquiſh'd, that with the more freedom, he might Preach Chriſt Crucify'd: This <hi>Timotheus</hi> was the Son of <hi>Pudens,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Senator, and of his Wife ſuppos'd to be the famous <hi>Claudia</hi> the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Lady foreſpoken of; He was alſo Brother of <hi>Novatus,</hi> as alſo of S. <hi>Pudentiana</hi> and <hi>Praxedes,</hi> whoſe memories are Anniverſarily cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> His coming hither is a conſiderable proof that his Mother was a <hi>Britain:</hi> It may be collected out of the Eccleſiaſtical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, that <hi>Pudentiana</hi> a Virgin, with her Siſter <hi>Praxedes</hi> the Daughters of <hi>Pudens,</hi> practiſing the Duties of Chriſtian Religion, with admirable Piety, Sold her Patrimony, and diſtributed to the Poor the Money thence ariſing; giving her ſelf wholly to Faſting and Prayer; by her Zeal and endeavours her whole Family conſiſting of 96. perſons was Converted to the Faith, and Baptiz'd by <hi>Pope Pius:</hi> And the publick Sacrifices being forbidden by <hi>Antoninus,</hi> the Holy <hi>Pope</hi> Celebrated the Divine Myſteries, with other Chriſtians in the Houſe of <hi>Pudentiana,</hi> who afforded thoſe Holy Perſons all neceſſary Suſtenance; and being thus imploy'd in ſuch Offices of Piety, ſhe dy'd the 14th. of the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> in the year of our Lord 161. and was bury'd in the <hi>Coemetery of Priſcilla,</hi> in the <hi>Salarian way.</hi>

Thoſe Titles were for the moſt part ſignify'd by Croſſes, and were firſt in the nature of particular Pariſhes, by <hi>Pope Evariſtus</hi> aſſign'd to the cure of particular Prieſts: The <hi>Bathes</hi> which are here nam'd from <hi>Novatus,</hi> have elſewere their denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Timotheus,</hi> and were ſcituated upon the mountain called <hi>Viminal:</hi> And in Truth the Chriſtians privately reſorted to this place for the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Divine Myſteries before any Church was Solemnly Conſecrated there, as may be found in the Acts of <hi>Juſtin</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> who calls it the <hi>Timothean Bath:</hi> The ſame year that <hi>Novatus</hi> dy'd, the Emperour <hi>Antoninus</hi> ended his Life, after him ſucceeded <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> and <hi>Lucius Verus,</hi> joyntly governing the Empire with equal Authority.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond year of theſe Emperours, dy'd the Holy Virgin <hi>Praxedes,</hi> the particulars of whoſe death are recorded by <hi>Paſtor</hi> in this manner. <hi>Two years and</hi> 18 <hi>days after this Church was Dedicated, there was a great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution rais'd against Chriſtians, to enforce them to Worſhip Idols, and many were Crown'd with Martyrdom: Now the Holy Virgin</hi> Praxedes; <hi>fervent in the Holy Ghost, ſecretly conceal'd many good Chriſtians in the ſaid Title or Church, whoſe bodies ſhe ſtrengthen'd with Food, and their minds with Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations proceeding from Gods ſpirit; Inſomuch, as notice was given to</hi> Aurelius <hi>that Chriſtian Aſſemblies were made in her Houſe; he then ſent his Officers thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who laid hold on</hi> Symitrius <hi>a Priest and</hi> 22 <hi>perſons more, all which the Cruel Emperour commanded to be put to Death in the ſame Title, without any Examination; their Bodies</hi> Praxedes <hi>took by night, and bury'd in the</hi> Coeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery <hi>of</hi> Priſcilla; <hi>but ſoon after afflicted for the ſuffering of the Saints, with many Groans ſhe Pray'd that ſhe might paſs out of this Life; her Prayers found acceſs unto our Lord Jeſus, for in the</hi> 44th. <hi>day after the Martyrdom of the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Saints, ſhe went unto the Lord, and</hi> Paſtor <hi>the Prieſt bury'd her Body in her Fathers</hi> Coemetery of Priſcilla <hi>upon the</hi> Salarian-way: <hi>This Perſecution was begun at the Inſtigation of</hi> Heathen Philoſophers, <hi>eſpecially of the beastly</hi> Cynicks, <hi>particularly of</hi> Creſcence, <hi>that infamous Wretch mention'd with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation by</hi> Juſtin Martyr.</p>

            <p>As to the Teſtimony of the Emperours, not ſuch as <hi>Nero, Vitellius</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi> whoſe favour to Chriſtians would have been diſgraceful, but of Princes Venerable in the World for Prudence and Courage, yet zealous for their own Superſtition, ſuch as <hi>Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius</hi> and <hi>Marcus Aurelius;</hi> and what their Teſtimony of the Chriſtians was, may be collected out of the Edict of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> as followeth.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:96414:10"/>
            <p>The Emperour <hi>Caeſar, Titus, Aelius Hadrianus, Antoninus Pius, Angustus</hi> higheſt Prieſt, this 15th. time poſſeſs'd of the Tribunitial Power, and this third time Conſul Father of his Country. <hi>To the People of</hi> Aſia <hi>Health; I am aſſur'd that the Gods will not permit thoſe men to lye hid in obſcurity, who refuſe to pay due Honour and Worſhip to them, for they themſelves will far more ſeverely puniſh ſuch, then you can. And you do not conſider, that by Moleſting and Tormenting thoſe men, whom you call Impious, and charge as Enemies to the Gods, you do thereby the more confirm and increaſe their Religion; for to them it is a thing more deſirable to be accus'd as Criminal, to lay down their Lives for their God, then to enjoy the preſent Life with worldly Contentment. Hence it is that by expoſing their Lives in this manner, they obtain over you a more Glorious victory, then if they ſhould perform whatever you require. Now as concerning the Earthquakes, which both in late times, and at this preſent alſo do happen; I judge very reaſonable to give you ſome Admonition: Whenſoever ſuch Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities befall you, ye are preſently diſheartned and in deſpair, you impute it ſtraight to their Religion, as if it alone were the cauſe of all misfortunes happening to you: On the other ſide, whenſoever any ſuch Accident befalls them, they are thereby incited to a more conſtant and firm Truſt in God: Whereas all that while, you either looſe all knowledge of God, and utterly deſpiſe all Sacred Duties; not only refuſing to pay the Worſhip and Service due to the Deity, but grievouſly vexing, and to death purſuing thoſe who do obſerve and reverence him. Now ſeveral Magiſtrates and Governours of our Provinces, have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore written Letters to our moſt Holy and Deify'd Father</hi> Hadrian, <hi>to whom his Anſwer and Reſcript was,</hi> That no further trouble ſhould be given to thoſe men, except they ſhould be otherwiſe guilty of any Crime, or had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign prejudicial to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. <hi>Many alſo have written to me in their favour, to whom my Anſwer was, That I aſſented to the Ordinance and Will of my late Father; And my pleaſure is, that if any ſhall hereafter offer any Injury or Vexation to any Chriſtian, as a Chriſtian, the perſon ſo perſecuted, though found indeed to be a Chriſtian, ſhall be preſently Acquitted, and his Accuſer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo juſt and due puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Edict, though directed particularly to <hi>Aſia,</hi> yet had influence over the whole <hi>Roman</hi> World; and what could more advantageouſly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Chriſtian Religion, than what this <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperour here pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd of it; and certainly the Teſtimony of ſuch an Enemy, who was of ſo great Authority, could not but impreſs mightily upon the Hearts of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate <hi>Heathens,</hi> much more upon King <hi>Lucius,</hi> who from his Parents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited a Spirit of kindneſs and liberality towards the Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>But as for the Powerful Teſtimonies, which Almighty God himſelf at this time ſignally gave to all Mankind, by delivering not only the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, but the Empire it ſelf from inevitable Deſtruction, by the Prayers of his Chriſtian Servants. Let <hi>Dio</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorian living in thoſe times, and a bitter Enemy to the Chriſtians, proclaim in his own words. <hi>The Emperour</hi> Marcus (ſaith he) <hi>after many Battles fought, and dangers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone in</hi> Germany, <hi>in ſubduing the</hi> Marcomanni <hi>and</hi> Jaziges, <hi>was enforc'd to a new and ſharp War againſt the</hi> Quadi, <hi>from which enſu'd a Victory happy to the</hi> Romans <hi>beyond their hope, obtain'd indeed by the miraculous favour of God; for the</hi> Romans <hi>in the midſt of the Battle, being brought in extream danger, were ſav'd after a wonderful manner, and meerly a ſpecial Divine aſſiſtance: They were narrowly inclos'd on all ſides by the</hi> Quadi, <hi>yet in places commodious fought valiantly; but the barbarous enemy craftily forbore to come to a general
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96414:10"/>Engagement, hoping without that hazard, to ſee the</hi> Romans <hi>deſtroy'd before their faces with extremity of Heat and Thirſt, whom by their Multitudes they had ſhut ſo in, that they could come by no Water. Now the</hi> Romans <hi>brought to theſe extreme difficulties, and tormented with Wounds, Diſeaſes, Thirſt, and the burning Heat of the Sun, could neither Fight, nor draw off from the place, nor expect any remedy; when behold on a ſuddain there was a gathering together of many Clouds, from which deſcended great ſhowers of Rain, to the great comfort and Refreſhment of the</hi> Romans; <hi>who being thus encourag'd by an unexpected aſſiſtance from Heaven, ſet upon their Enemies, (aſtoniſh'd at ſuch a Miracle,) and forc'd them to flee; and ſeeing many of them in their flight kill'd with Lightning and Thunder-bolts from Heaven, ſo as it was notorious to all the World, that this ſo great Deliverance and Victory was the work not of Men but God only.</hi> Now though <hi>Dio</hi> was by clear conviction enforc'd to the Confeſſion of Divine Goodneſs, yet his malice and envy againſt the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> provok'd him to attribute this clear Miracle to <hi>Magick,</hi> or ſome falſe God, rather than to the true God of <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> For he adds in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of his Diſcourſe, <hi>That the report then was, that a certain</hi> Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Magician, <hi>call'd</hi> Arnuphis, <hi>then attending on the Emperour, did by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Arts invoke</hi> Mercury; <hi>eſpecially that Deity who rules in the Air, and other</hi> Daemons, <hi>and by their aſſiſtance forcibly procur'd thoſe ſhowers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Xiphilin</hi> the Abridger of <hi>Dio</hi>'s Hiſtory, evidently convinces this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, ſhewing firſt, that this Emperour was never addicted to the deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Magick,</hi> or affected to the Profeſſors of ſuch Arts; and afterwards declaring the true circumſtances of the matter to this effect. <q>
                  <hi>Marcus</hi> (ſaith he) having in his Army one Legion, conſiſting of Souldiers which came from <hi>Armenia,</hi> and were all Worſhipers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Prefect of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian</hi> Bands came to him when he was in great fear, what would become of his Armies, and at a loſs what courſe to take; and told him, there was nothing ſo difficult, but thoſe who were call'd <hi>Chriſtians</hi> could obtain from God; of which Profeſſion, there was then in the Army one entire Legion: <hi>Marcus</hi> thus inform'd, deſir'd the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to make Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their God, in behalf of the Army; which as ſoon as they had done, God immediately granted their Prayers, and with the ſame Showres re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> and deſtroy'd their Enemies:</q> 
               <hi>Marcus</hi> wonderfully aſtoniſh'd with theſe Events, by a publick Edict honour'd the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and call'd that Legion, the <hi>Thundering Legion;</hi> as by an Epiſtle of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour extant at this day may appear; and by the Apologies alſo of <hi>Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Niſſen,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian, &amp;c.</hi> is made alſo manifeſt.</p>
            <p>The fore-mention'd Epiſtle follows in theſe words. <q>The Emperour <hi>Caeſar, Marcus Aurelius, Auguſtus,</hi> &amp;c. High Prieſt, in the 28th. year of our Tribunitial Power, and our third Conſulſhip, Father of our Country, Pro-Conſul to the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſends Health; I have given you Information touching the greatneſs of our preſent Deſign and Reſolution, and all the Occurences which ſucceſſively happen'd to me in <hi>Germany,</hi> both in our Combats and Sieges. Truly when I was at <hi>Cornutum,</hi> our Scouts inform'd us, that there approach'd within the ſpace of nine Miles, no fewer then 74 Enſigns of our Enemies; and the ſame thing did <hi>Pompeianus</hi> our General declare to us, which our ſelves likewiſe ſaw. Now having in our Army only four Legions, the Firſt, the Tenth, the Twin Legion, and that of the <hi>Ferentarii;</hi> and there being in our Enemies Camp no ſewer then 977000. when I compar'd our ſmall Forces with the vaſt multitudes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96414:11"/>of our Barbarous Foes, I addreſs'd my Prayers and Vows to our <hi>Roman</hi> Gods; But when I ſaw that was neglected by them, and that the Enemy began to over-charge us; I ſent to call the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which were not a few in our Army, whom both by Prayers and Threats alſo I urg'd to aſſiſt us, but Threats were neither needful, nor indeed ſeemly, as I perceiv'd afterwards, when I found how Powerful they were: For they underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our Defence, did not take care to provide themſelves Weapons, or to make uſe of Arms or Trumpets; for to put their truſt in ſuch things, is not acceptable to that God, whoſe Name, Cauſe and Honour they alway car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their Hearts. Therefore it is juſt, that we ſhould acknowledge thoſe to be ſafely protected by God, whom formerly we eſteem'd to be Impious, and Enemies to him. For having caſt themſelves Proſtrate to the ground, they offer'd their Prayers, not only for Me, but for the whole Army, that ſome remedy might be ſent us, to aſſwage the Hunger and Thirſt with which we were tormented: For by the ſpace of five days, we had Drank no Water, there being none left amongſt us, nor means to procure any, we being clos'd round about with Mountains in the very heart of <hi>Germany:</hi> Now as ſoon as theſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had caſt themſelves on the ground, and Addreſs'd their Prayers to that God, of whom I was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, immediately there fell from Heaven abundance of Rain, which to us was Cool and Refreſhing; but to the Enemies, was accompany'd with Hail in the likeneſs of Fire, and with Thunder-bolts: Thus that God who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be overcome, or reſiſted, was in a wonderful manner Propitious to their Prayers and Supplications. For this reaſon, let us freely permit ſuch as theſe to be what they Profeſs, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> leaſt we force them by their Prayers to obtain ſuch Weapons againſt us from Heaven: My Judgement and Sentence therefore is, that none be queſtion'd, or call'd into Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Charge that he is a <hi>Christian;</hi> So that if any one be found to lay this as a Crime againſt any one, that he is a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> let it be made known to the perſon ſo accus'd, that he is to be preſently diſmiſs'd and acquitted, in caſe no other Crime be objected againſt him; and let Him who accus'd ſuch <hi>Christian,</hi> be Burnt Alive: Whoſoever therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes himſelf a <hi>Christian,</hi> is hereby freed from any danger in that regard threatned againſt him: Neither let the Magiſtrate who governs the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, endeavour to make him renounce his Profeſſion, or any ways abridge his Liberty. And my Sentence moreover is, That this Edict be further Eſtabliſh'd by Decree of the Senate, and publickly expos'd in the Common place of <hi>Trajan,</hi> that any one may Read it; let <hi>Vetruſius Pollio</hi> likewiſe Prefect of the City, take order that this Conſtitution be ſent into all Provinces; neither let any one be prohibited to take a Copy, or make uſe of it, <hi>Farewel.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperour not content with ſo much advange to Celebrate the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Power and Goodneſs of the true God by Edicts and Writings pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd to the whole World, proceeded to a yet more Illuſtrious Expreſſion of his gratitude: And becauſe Edicts were only in force for the preſent age, He, to Eternize the memory of ſo great a Deliverance, rais'd up, in a ſpacious place at <hi>Rome,</hi> a vaſt Pillar, on which was engrav'd the whole Hiſtory, to be read in all future times.</p>
            <p>Certainly ſuch a Confeſſion of the Debility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Deities, and the Omnipotence of the True God Worſhip'd only by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> made by the moſt Wiſe, Learn'd and Virtuous Emperour of the <hi>Romans,</hi> muſt needs
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96414:11"/>have a ſtrange influence on the minds of many men throughout the whole Empire, to incline them to conform themſelves to his Judgement, though his Practiſe were otherwiſe, for Worldly reſpects; and indeed it produc'd a number of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> not only out of the Vulgar Rank, but of Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Noted Perſons; Inſomuch, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> (a <hi>Christian</hi> Writer of the next Age,) declares to the <hi>Romans, That though they counted</hi> Chriſtians <hi>as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we fill all your places, your Cities, Iſles, Caſtles, Free-Towns, Camps, Tribes, Corporations, Palaces, Senates,</hi> &amp;c. No wonder then if our <hi>Britiſh</hi> King <hi>Lucius</hi> prepar'd as aforeſaid, and inform'd by <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellius</hi> and <hi>Pertinax,</hi> principal Officers ſent into <hi>Britain,</hi> not only of the ſaid Miraculous Deliverance, but what numbers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Nobility and Senators had thereupon given up their Names to Chriſt: No wonder if <hi>Lucius</hi> thus convinc'd in Judgement, and not deter'd by the <hi>Roman</hi> Civil Power, at laſt ſubmitted his neck to the ſame eaſy yoak.</p>
            <p>As for our <hi>Bale</hi>'s conceit that <hi>Trebellius</hi> and <hi>Pertinax</hi> were both <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and wrought upon <hi>Lucius;</hi> there is no ground in Hiſtory for it: And as to the manner and order of this Kings Converſion, it might have been more clearly publiſh'd to the World, had not the Antient Hiſtory of <hi>Elevanus,</hi> who liv'd in the time of <hi>Pope Eleutherius,</hi> been loſt; Nevertheleſs, what may be glean'd out of Primitive Records, as Relicks of Antient Tradition, ſhall not be omitted, eſpecially if approv'd by modern Authors: Amongſt the reſt thus writes <hi>Bale,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Lucius</hi> (as he conjectures) was ſcandaliz'd at the meanneſs and poverty of Chriſt, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were: For though Chriſtian Religion had for the ſpace of more than 100. years been propagated in <hi>Britain,</hi> yet it ſeem'd to be depriv'd of its due ſplendour, becauſe hitherto Adminiſtred by ſimple, poor and contemptible perſons, and wanted the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Empire to ſupport it. Therefore as ſoon as the ſaid King was inform'd by the Emperour's Lieutenants, that upon the ceaſing of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, many Illuſtrious <hi>Romans</hi> had embrac'd the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> he then began to entertain a more worthy conceit of it; and now ſeriouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring this Holy Faith, with what he had learn'd from his <hi>Druids,</hi> the Simplicity and Sanctity of the one, with the foul and barbarous Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the other, and conſidering the ineſtimable Promiſes of Eternal Glory and Happineſs, propos'd and aſſur'd in and by the Goſpel, to any ſhare whereof his own Prieſts never pretended the leaſt claim, he grew weary of his former Errours, and was willing to be further inſtructed in thoſe Verities, with a few Beams whereof he had been formerly Enlightned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore though there wanted not ſuch as had skill enough to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie this King, in the Truth of Chriſtian Religion, eſpecially <hi>Elvanus</hi> before mention'd, and <hi>Medwinus</hi> among the <hi>Belgae;</hi> yet the prudent King (by their advice, no doubt,) thought himſelf oblig'd to implore a greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, for the Eſtabliſhing a new Church, and ſettling the common Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Religion amongſt his Subjects. However, though in his neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdom of <hi>Gaule,</hi> many renown'd and learn'd Biſhops were then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, eſpecially St. <hi>Iraeneus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lyons;</hi> yet to none of theſe had <hi>Lucius</hi> particular recourſe, but ſent two Meſſengers through that Nation, directing them to St. <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> a worthy Succeſſor of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Apoſtolick Chair, which He, with the whole Chriſtian World took to be the Fountain of all Eccleſiaſtical Jurisdiction: This he might well learn from St. <hi>Iraeneus</hi> againſt Hereſies; who declares, <hi>That every Church, and all Chriſtians where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dſpers'd, ſhould have recourſe to the</hi> Roman Church, <hi>by reaſon of its more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96414:12"/>Powerſul Principality. Tertullian</hi> alſo, then an Eminent Prieſt, would have given the ſame advice, for thus he beſpeaks his Readers, <hi>Who ever thou art,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who would'ſt better imploy thy Curioſity in the buſineſs of thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, take a view of the Principal Churches founded by the Apoſtles. If</hi> Italy <hi>be neareſt to thee, thou mayest repair to</hi> Rome, <hi>from whence our Authority in</hi> Africk <hi>is likewiſe deriv'd; a Church it is happy in its conſtitution: To which the chief Apoſtles, together with their Blood, ſhed forth the whole Doctrine of Chriſtianity.</hi> And as for St. <hi>Iraeneus,</hi> he gives a Catalogue of all the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the time of <hi>Eleatherius,</hi> with whom he was Contemporary; and with his Catalogue, this Aſſertion. <hi>By making known the Faith of that chiefeſt and moſt Antient Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>renown'd throughout the whole World, founded and conſtituted by the moſt glorious Apoſtles St.</hi> Peter <hi>and St.</hi> Paul, <hi>and by an un-interrupted Succeſſion of Biſhops deriv'd to our times, we confound all thoſe who any way either by an unlawful ſelf-love, vain glory, blindneſs, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Opinion, make ſeparated congregations profeſſing other Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore to <hi>Elutherius</hi> Paſtor of this Church, King <hi>Lucius</hi> addreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to obtain Laws and Ordinances neceſſary for the conſtitution of a well order'd Church in this Kingdom; what his Meſſage was, our Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> hath declar'd out of an Antient Book belonging to the Monaſtery of <hi>Abing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> namely, <hi>That King</hi> Lucius <hi>having heard the Fame of the Sanctity of Preachers at that time in</hi> Rome, <hi>ſent his Meſſengers with publick Letters in great Expedition, moſt devoutly and earnestly beſeeching the venerable</hi> Pope Eleutherius, <hi>that by his Order and Will he might be made a Chriſtian.</hi> It is true, the Biſhop will by no means attribute this to the Primacy of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Biſhop, but to the Commerce and ſtrict Alliance between the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd <hi>Britains</hi> and that Imperial City; contrary to the plain Judgements of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> before-mention'd, and the Traditionary practice of all Ages. In the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Author of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Antiquities, we may find who were this Kings Meſſengers, namely <hi>Elvanus</hi> and <hi>Medwinus</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, and what their Meſſage was more particularly, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop, that he would be pleas'd to direct his Legates, with order to Baptize him, being already indued with Chriſtian Doctrine, and that they might bring the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws with them, according to which he might Order and Eſtabliſh both the Eccleſiaſtical and Civil State of his Kingdom.</q> The Pious Biſhop <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> much more zealous to propagate the Divine Doctrine, than to Illuſtrate his own Fame, ſignify'd to the King his inexpreſſible joy for the gaining of ſo great a King to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt, but for the Civil ordering of his Kingdom, thought his intereſſing himſelf therein, would be to little purpoſe; for thoſe Laws were not neceſſary for the conſtitution of a <hi>Chriſtian Commonwealth,</hi> and that by them many things were eſtabliſh'd, which ought not to be obſerv'd by thoſe who profeſs the Chriſtian Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Bede</hi> mentioning theſe requeſts of the King to <hi>Pope Eleutherius,</hi> adds preſently, <hi>That he obtain'd the effect of his Pious Petition, as to ſo much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as concern'd his further inſtruction in Chriſtian Religion;</hi> As may appear by the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Anſwer, preſerv'd to this day by <hi>Matthew of Weſtminſter,</hi> as followeth; <q>Your requeſt to Us is, that we would tranſmit to you a Copy of the <hi>Roman</hi> and Imperial Laws, which it ſeems you deſire to make uſe of in your Kingdom of <hi>Britain:</hi> But you muſt be inform'd, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, and ſuch as are Enacted by the Emperour, are not of ſuch obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but they may be at any time rejected, which the Law of God in no
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96414:12"/>Caſe muſt be. Now by the Divine Mercy you have of late ſubmitted your ſelf in your Kingdom of <hi>Britain,</hi> to the Law and Faith of Chriſt, ſo that you have already with you both the Old and New Teſtament, out of Them therefore, by Gods Inſpiration, and with the common Councel of your Kingdom collect and frame a Law, and by it (through the Divine aſſiſtance) govern your Kingdom of <hi>Britain.</hi> You are Gods Deputy in your Kingdom, according as the Kingly Prophet ſays, <hi>The Earth is our Lords and the fulneſs of it, the round World and all that dwell in it:</hi> And again, the ſame Kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt lov'd Righteouſneſs, and hated Iniquity, Therefore thy God hath Anointed thee with the Oyl of Gladneſs above thy Fellows;</hi> And again, <hi>Give thy Judgements to the King, and thy Juſtice,</hi> &amp;c. He ſaith, <hi>thy Judgement,</hi> not the Judgement and Juſtice of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for the Chriſtian Nations and People of your Kingdom, who live under your peaceable Protection, are the Children of God, under his care, who according to the Goſpel, <hi>Protect them as a Hen, gathering her Chickens under her Wings,</hi> &amp;c. The Nations therefore of your Kingdom are your People, which being hitherto divided, you ought to gather into one unanimous Congregation to the Obedience of the Faith and Law of Chriſt, conſtituting of them one Church, which you muſt Cheriſh, Maintain, Protect and Govern, that ſo you may Reign with Chriſt for ever, whoſe Deputy you are in the ſaid Kingdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Some modern Writers add, indeed ſome other paſſages incoherent and impertinent to it, moſt likely to be Fictitious, as perhaps the whole Epiſtle may be thought to be, did not the credit of <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Meſtminſter</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſupport it: Be the Objections againſt it, or the Additions to it what they will, ſure it is the Converſion of St. <hi>Lucius</hi> doth not much depend upon it. Doubtleſs, this, or ſome ſuch like Anſwer was brought back by <hi>Elvanus</hi> and <hi>Medwinus,</hi> and with them came two other Holy men, Commiſſion'd by <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius,</hi> not only to Inſtruct and Baptize the King, and thoſe who by his imitation embrac'd the Chriſtian Faith, but to order and eſtabliſh all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Affairs in the Kingdom; the Names of thoſe two Commiſſioners were <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus,</hi> accounted well qualify'd for their Miſſion, and of the degree of Biſhops or Preiates, that they might be able to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate Churches, Erect Biſhopricks, Diſpenſe Orders, and the like.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Elvanus</hi> and <hi>Medwinus</hi> good Authors write, that the firſt was Conſecrated Biſhop at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the other Preacher or Doctor of the Chriſtian Faith; Though there be others, who upon little or no ground, ſuppoſe them only <hi>Cathecumens</hi> when they went thither, and conſequently uncapable of ſuch Preferment: Whereas it is very probable that they were eminent Preachers of the Chriſtian Faith to King <hi>Lucius</hi> and others; and as appears by Antient Monuments, they were Diſciples of <hi>Joſeph of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathaea,</hi> bred up at <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> full of Zeal to Gods Glory according to knowledge, and accuſtom'd to a Contemplative Life in Prayer and Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> admitted to the Preſence of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him from whom they were ſent, and upon what Errand; forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the King, and his whole Family, with many others, receiv'd Baptiſm, according to the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: The name of the Queen to King <hi>Lucius</hi> is not recorded, but his Siſter Baptiz'd with him, in Antient Records, is Nam'd <hi>Emerita,</hi> of whoſe Holineſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in Martyrdom, more is to be ſaid hereafter: As for the particular form this King was Baptiz'd in, it was certainly done according to the <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:96414:13"/>Church, conformable no doubt to the Ordinances of the Apoſtles, as St. <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> living all in or about that Age, do confidently Affirm, <hi>Now, though to the Eſſence of Baptiſm, nothing is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd than due matter, which is Water, a due form of Words, and a right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of him who confers it:</hi> Yet even in theſe Primitive times, other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and Ceremonious Rites were ſubjoyn'd, the more effectually to apply and imprint the force and virtue of that Sacrament in the minds of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, as is moſt evident from Tradition, and the Writings of thoſe times; and this by the preſcription even of the Apoſtles themſelves and their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Succeſſors; But if not ſo, who can deny the Authority of the Church, as to the creating ſuch Ceremonies as may make the Celebration of the Holy Sacraments more Solemn and Auguſt, eſpecially conſidering what our Lord hath pronounc'd concerning his Church, <hi>He that heareth</hi> (or obeyeth) <hi>you, heareth me.</hi> Of theſe Additional Rites, the principal are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> The Arming the Baptiz'd perſon with the Sign of the <hi>Croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> The Anointing his Head with Holy Oyl and Chriſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The Bleſſing of the Water deſign'd for Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The uſing of Exorciſms and Holy Prayers, to drive away the Enemy of Mankind.</p>
            <p>All theſe Rites were practic'd in the Primitive times, as may be prov'd by a cloud of Faithful Witneſſes in ſeveral Ages, by conſtant Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as St. <hi>Baſil</hi> fully demonſtrates. <q>After the adminiſtration of Baptiſm to the King, thoſe Holy men <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Elvanus</hi> and <hi>Medwinus</hi> wholly imploy'd themſelves in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel of Chriſt, through all the Provinces of the Kingdom; in diſputing againſt the Superſtition of the <hi>Druids,</hi> and demonſtrating the vanity of their Idols, and the abominableneſs of their Horrible Sacrifices: And being attended with the Kings Authority and Zeal, they broke in pieces thoſe Idols, and eaſily perſwaded the <hi>Britains</hi> to renounce their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Superſtitions: So that in a ſhort ſpace, the Chriſtian Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the only true God, came generally to be had in Honour and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> adds, That theſe Bleſſed Teachers having in a great meaſure defac'd Idolatry through all <hi>Britain,</hi> they Dedicated to the Honour of one God and his Saints, thoſe Temples which had been found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Worſhip of many falſe Gods, filling them with Aſſemblies of Lawfull Paſtors. Saying further, That in divers Cities of the Kingdom they conſtituted, or at leaſt deſign'd 28 Biſhops, ſubject to three Archbiſhops, or Metropolitan Sees, the prime whereof was <hi>London,</hi> to which <hi>Cornwall</hi> and all the Provinces on the <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> were actually ſubjected, or deſign'd ſo to be. The Second was <hi>York,</hi> to which was laid <hi>Deira</hi> and <hi>Albania</hi> divided from <hi>Loegria,</hi> or the former part by the River <hi>Humber.</hi> The third, the City of <hi>Legions,</hi> which had Dominion over <hi>Cambria</hi> or <hi>Wales,</hi> ſever'd from <hi>Loegria</hi> by the River <hi>Severn.</hi>
               </q> This City was call'd <hi>Caerleon,</hi> and ſcituate upon the River <hi>Oſca</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſk,</hi> as by the ruines there may appear: At the firſt indeed Biſhops did not confine themſelves to one place, but exercis'd their Paſtoral Duties from one place to another, as they had occaſion; but after their Flocks incrcaſing, each Biſhop was limited to his peculiar Flock, and ſeated themſelves in the eminent Cities, then in number about 28. and conſequently ſo many Biſhops were ordain'd.</p>
            <p>We find in the Antient Book belonging to the Monaſtery of <hi>Abingdon,</hi> to this effect, <hi>That</hi> Eleutherius <hi>ſent his Miſſioners</hi> Faganus <hi>and</hi> Divianus, <hi>Learn'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96414:13"/>and Holy men to King</hi> Lucius, <hi>who Baptiz'd the King, and his People embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Christian Faith, deſtroy'd Idols, and built Churches, and decreed that in thoſe Cities, where formerly reſided</hi> Arch-flamens, <hi>according to the</hi> Pagan <hi>Superstition, there Arch-biſhops ſhould be eſtabliſh'd, and where ordinary</hi> Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens <hi>were, there Biſhops ſhould ſucceed, the chief Cities then were</hi> London, York <hi>and</hi> Caerleon, <hi>which became the Seats of three Arch-biſhops.</hi> Poſſibly the Title of <hi>Flamens</hi> and <hi>Arch-flamens</hi> was given to theſe <hi>Druid</hi> Prieſts by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who might be diſtinguiſh'd amongſt themſelves by ſome other Name.</p>

XXVIII. <hi>Cair Luitcoit,</hi> or <hi>Lindcoit,</hi> or <hi>Lindum,</hi> now <hi>Lincoln:</hi> Theſe were the 28 Cities, perhaps not all extant in the days of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> at leaſt under thoſe Names, which were deſign'd then for the Seats of Arch-biſhops and Biſhops; though perhaps ſome other might be deſign'd for that purpoſe: And it may be the Name of Arch-biſhops was not then us'd, yet the juriſdiction was alike, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of Metropolitans, from the Metropolis, or moſt Eminent Cities. How many of theſe Cities were ſupply'd with Biſhops, is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Records only mention, beſides <hi>Elvanus</hi> Conſecrated at <hi>Rome, Theanus</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:96414:14"/>only, a <hi>Britain</hi> and firſt Metropolitan Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> where our Devout King <hi>Lucius</hi> built a Church in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> Conſecrated to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Truth whereof is manifeſted by an Inſcription on an Antient Table not long ſince hanging in the ſaid Church, to this effect following, <hi>In the year of our Lord</hi> 179. Lucius <hi>the firſt Chriſtian King of this Land, founded the firſt Church at</hi> London, <hi>namely the Church of St.</hi> Peter <hi>in</hi> Cornhill: He eſtabliſh'd there an Arch-Epiſcopal See, it was the prime Church of the Kingdom, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd for 400. years until the coming of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Apoſtle of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Some make <hi>Theanus</hi> Founder of this Church, aſſiſted therein by <hi>Cira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the Kings Cup-bearer: How long <hi>Theanus</hi> govern'd in this See, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, however he was ſucceeded by St. <hi>Elvanus,</hi> though <hi>Malmſburienſis</hi> makes it doubtful in what place the Arch-Epiſcopal juriſdiction was fix'd, during the time of the <hi>Britains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> after their three years ſucceſsful Labours in this new Vineyard of our Lord, (as <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> witneſs,) return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> to give an account to St. <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> how affairs ſtood in <hi>Britain.</hi> As to this, <hi>Matthew of Weſtminſter</hi> expreſſes himſelf moſt fully, affirming, <hi>That in the year of Grace</hi> 186. <hi>the Bleſsed Prelates,</hi> Fugatius <hi>and</hi> Damianus <hi>return'd to</hi> Rome, <hi>and obtain'd from the Holy</hi> Pope Eleutherius, <hi>a confirmation of all they had done in</hi> Britain, <hi>and then came back again, accompany'd with many others:</hi> By whoſe Inſtructions the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation being confirm'd in the Faith of Chriſt, became Illuſtrious; the Names and Acts of theſe Holy men may be found in the Hiſtory of our <hi>Gildas,</hi> concerning the Victory of <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the practice of Chriſtian Churches to have frequent recourſe to the Chair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and about this very time the Church of <hi>Lions</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> ſent <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to St. <hi>Eleutherius</hi> for the reſolving of queſtions about Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affairs, as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> witneſseth; and of the ſame Errand, before this time, went St. <hi>Beatus</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> as is before-mention'd. This hath been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done in a due Subordination to the Supream Tribunal of the Church, and for the preſervation of Unity, the Center whereof the Chair of St. <hi>Peter</hi> was ever accounted.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> came back into <hi>Britain,</hi> they preſented the King with a Crown Bleſs'd by that Holy <hi>Pope,</hi> with many Divine Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, more acceptable than the Crown, relating to the Government of his Civil State, and his Defence of Holy Church: It is ſaid the <hi>Pope</hi> alſo preſcrib'd the limits of his Kingdom ſo far <hi>Northerly,</hi> that ſome conjecture, that from thence it is, that ſo many of thoſe <hi>Northern</hi> Provinces became ſubject to the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction of the Metropolitan Church of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other Churches were afterwards built; as firſt at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in the place of an Idol Temple conſecrated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> which in the Reign of <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus Pius</hi> was by an Earthquake caſt to the ground; This Church from the days of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> was deſign'd for a Burying place of our Kings, as at this day, and after it was Re-edify'd by St. <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor. A ſecond Metropolitan Church was about this time erected in the City of <hi>York,</hi> eſteem'd in that Age the prime City and Church of <hi>Britain.</hi> The third Metropolitan Church was then alſo built at <hi>Landaff</hi> or <hi>Caerleon</hi> upon <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>sk,</hi> in which City, (now ruin'd,) were three Noble Churches; one bearing the Title of the Holy Martyr <hi>Julius,</hi> Beautifi'd with a Monaſtery of Virgins Conſecrated to God. A ſecond founded by the Name of his Companion St. <hi>Aaron;</hi> And a third famous for being the Metropolitan See of all <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria;</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:96414:14"/>although <hi>Dubritius</hi> is mention'd in Hiſtory to be the firſt Arch-biſhop of the <hi>Welſh Britains;</hi> concerning the Church of <hi>Landaff,</hi> and the Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it, ſomething may be gather'd out of the Proteſtation of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanus</hi> before <hi>Calixtus</hi> the ſecond, in the Councel of <hi>Rhemes.</hi> However, ſure it is, that after the coming of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk, the Biſhop of <hi>Landaff</hi> hath always been ſubject to the See of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This King <hi>Lucius</hi> built another Church alſo at <hi>Dover,</hi> in Honour of our Bleſſed Saviour and his Glorious Mother, and ſome other Churches elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: As this King ſhew'd himſelf Munificent in Building of Churches, ſo alſo was he Liberal in his Endowments and Priviledges beſtow'd upon them, by transferring the Poſſeſſions of Idol-Temples to Chriſtian Churches, and further Enriching them with more Lands and greater Immunities; ſo that ſome Malefactors might have refuge within their Precincts, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Sanctuary hath been continu'd and increas'd by moſt ſucceeding Princes; neither were the Revenues belonging to <hi>Pagan</hi> Temples incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, for that Religion was very coſtly; for it is certain, that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Flamens</hi> in <hi>London</hi> Sacrific'd yearly 40000. Cows, 100000. Sheep, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ſorts of all Fowl, beſides 30000. Savage Beaſts, as Staggs, and other Beaſts of the Forreſt. Beſides all this, King <hi>Lucius</hi> in the 6th. year after his Converſion, Founded a Church and Monaſtery at <hi>Winchester,</hi> which he plentifully Endow'd; it is ſaid to be a Church of vaſt Dimenſions, and Adorn'd with an Epiſcopal Palace, the Poſſeſſions of it extended 12. Miles round about the City: This Church was Dedicated to the Honour of our Saviour by <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus,</hi> and <hi>Devotus</hi> a Monk by them Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the firſt Abbot; from this time, until the time of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> the Monks here quietly ſerv'd God; after the Rule and Order preſcrib'd by St. <hi>Mark</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> and firſt Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which Rule is thus deſcrib'd by <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Theſe</hi> Monks <hi>did not content themſelves to retain the order of living, practis'd by the Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> whereof we read in the Acts of the Apoſtles, <hi>That they had all things in common, accounted nothing their own, ſold their Poſſeſſions and laid the price at the Apoſtles feet, to be divided amongſt ſuch as had need:</hi> But theſe <hi>Monks</hi> aſpir'd to practices more ſublime, for reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to the moſt ſecret places, they led a Life of unparallel'd Abſtinence and Auſterity, in Reading of Holy Scripture day and night, in fervent Prayer, and continual Labour of their Hands, without regard of Food or Suſtenance, ſave only that every ſecond or third day they would receive ſome ſlender Suſtenance for neceſſity, not for the ſatisfaction of their Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and not then until after Sun-ſet: The Light they ſpent in Labour or Holy Exerciſes, Darkneſs ſuffic'd for the care of their Bodies. Under the Perſecution of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> this Holy Fraternity was diſſipated, but not long after again reſtor'd, and their Church Conſecrated by <hi>Conſtantius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> in the year of Grace 309. taking a new Name from St. <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus,</hi> who with St. <hi>Alban</hi> was Crown'd with Martyrdom; and by this Name <hi>Gildas</hi> calls it in his relation of the Sons of <hi>Mordred,</hi> Murder'd by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in this place. It ſuffer'd a ſecond Eclipſe, when the Infidel <hi>Saxons</hi> laid waſte all Holy places in this Iſland; Howbeit no ſooner did the <hi>Saxons</hi> embrace the Faith of Chriſt, but they repair'd this Church and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, after call'd <hi>de Hida,</hi> and reſtor'd it to greater Splendor and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence then it had before; in which Splendor and Beauty it continu'd forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd by Charters of Kings and Bulls of <hi>Popes,</hi> untill all Religious Houſes were ſwallow'd up by the ſury and Avarice of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. So as St. <hi>Edward</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:96414:15"/>the Confeſſor in his Charter to the Monaſtery of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> prov'd a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who declar'd, <hi>The ſame Charter ſhould continue in force, ſo long as the love of Chriſtianity ſhould remain in this Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Devout and Wiſe King <hi>Lucius,</hi> did not only endow Churches and Monaſteries for the preſent Worſhip of God, but provided Seminaries of Learning and Piety, for the future increaſe thereof; the moſt Famous of which was the School and Monaſtery of <hi>Bangor</hi> in <hi>North-Wales:</hi> It is ſaid to be the firſt Colledge of <hi>Chriſtian Philoſophers,</hi> but is in ſome Authors miſtaken, for another of that Name in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster,</hi> from whence proceeded the famous Biſhop St. <hi>Malachias,</hi> whoſe Life is elegantly written by St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> However this famous Monaſtery, it ſeems, proſper'd ſo well for a long time, that at the coming of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> more than 2000. <hi>Monks</hi> were found in it. This King was not only careful to plant and ſettle the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> within his own Kingdom, but as many Antient and Credible Records teſtifie, perſonally ſow'd the Seeds of Chriſtianity in <hi>Germany</hi> and other Forreign parts, and as ſome ſay there ended his days, as his Virgin Siſter and Martyr alſo did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fugatius</hi> or <hi>Phaganus</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> being inform'd of St. <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Companion's retirement to <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> and their deaths there, viſited the place, which they found reduc'd to little better then a Covert of Wild-Beaſts, ſo little encouragement or countenance had the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd; yet by Divine conduct, they diſcover'd an Antient Church built by St. <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Companions, and Conſecrated as afore-ſaid, by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, they alſo found the <hi>Holy-Croſs,</hi> with ſeveral Writings and other Tokens, declaring the place to have been formerly an Habitation of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> and receptable of thoſe prime Diſciples. They therefore added ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Oratory built of Stone, Dedicated to the Honour of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>St. Paul,</hi> and on the Top of the <hi>Tor</hi> or Mountain, rais'd a Chappel to the Honour of St. <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Arch-Angel;</hi> And laſtly to continue the Service of God which had been interrupted, they eſtabliſh'd a ſucceſſion of 12 Devout perſons in memory of St. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and the firſt 12. which Succeſſion conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd till the coming of St. <hi>Patrick</hi> (the Apoſtle of <hi>Ireland</hi>) unto this place. Theſe two Holy men made this place their Retirement for the ſpace of nine years, and there dy'd, and were bury'd, as is believ'd, about the year of our Lord 199. After the Death of <hi>Lucius,</hi> which happen'd in the 7th. year of <hi>Severus,</hi> none of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Race were permitted to reign, but Legats from the Emperour, commanding the <hi>Roman</hi> Army. In the time of <hi>Commodus,</hi> little more of moment is mention'd concerning the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Affairs, ſave that in his time <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpius Marcellus</hi> drove back the <hi>Caledonian Britains,</hi> who had made Irruptions into the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories in <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Converſion of <hi>Britain</hi> was ſo famous in the Church of God, that <hi>Origen</hi> takes notice of it; and the Faith of Chriſt ſpread it ſelf even unto the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of this Iſland within two years after the Death of <hi>Lucius,</hi> inſomuch as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who liv'd about theſe times, cryes out, <hi>That thoſe Provinces of</hi> Britain, <hi>into which the</hi> Roman <hi>Armies were not able to pierce, yet willingly ſubmitted to the Faith of our Bleſſed Saviour.</hi>

               <hi>Donaldus</hi> then King of thoſe <hi>Northern</hi> quarters, rejected the Worſhip of Divels, embrac'd the Faith of Chriſt, and obtain'd of <hi>Pope Victor</hi> the 15th. after St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſeveral Learn'd and Illuſtrious men to be ſent into thoſe <hi>Northern</hi> parts to Baptize himſelf, his Wife and Family, with many of his Nobility: <hi>Fulgentius</hi> a Kinſman of <hi>Lucius,</hi> was certainly the firſt who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96414:15"/>the love of Chriſtian Verities into the mind of <hi>Donaldus,</hi> and advis'd him to ſend to <hi>Victor</hi> for more perfect Inſtructions: By the conduct and Courage of this <hi>Fulgentius, Donaldus</hi> obtain'd a great Victory over the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: Severus</hi> himſelf was ſain to engage his own Preſence and Authority, to repair this loſs by a formidable Army; this great exploit of the Emperour obtain'd him and his Sons the Title of <hi>Britanicus: Fulgentius</hi> not long after ended his Life at <hi>York,</hi> then the Imperial City. <hi>Severus</hi> after this Victory built a new Wall, with frequent Towers, and a vaſt deep Trench, and then retir'd with his Army to <hi>York,</hi> but by the way was met and daunted with an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Souldier, <hi>Cole-black</hi> and Crown'd with <hi>Cypreſs,</hi> who told him, <hi>He had been all, and overcame all,</hi> and bid him, <hi>now be a God:</hi> This was an ill Omen, which, with others of like ſort, are ſaid to preſage his Death, and indeed it follow'd ſoon after, in that City where he was with exquiſite Ceremonies made a God, but his Aſhes with Coſtly Odours were gather'd into a precious Box, and with great veneration carry'd to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is obſerv'd that theſe <hi>Caledonian Britains,</hi> us'd no Garments, but mark'd their Bodies with <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of Beaſts, as their chief bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and from thence no doubt came to be call'd <hi>Picts,</hi> or a Painted People.</p>
            <p>In the fourth year of <hi>Antoninus Baſſianus</hi> dy'd <hi>Donaldus,</hi> who Coin'd Silver and Gold, marking it on the one ſide with the Figure of the <hi>Saving-Croſs,</hi> on the other ſide with his own Face, thereby to propagate the memory of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> firſt embrac'd by him, among all the Kings of that Nation; he was bury'd in a field with Chriſtian Ceremonies and Solemnities, the ſame field having been Conſecrated with accuſtom'd Prayers for the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of Chriſtians. By this the preſent Inhabitants of <hi>Scotland</hi> may diſcern the difference between the Chriſtianity of this their firſt Chriſten'd King, and that which they have lately choſen inſtead of it: He would not reſt after Death, but in a place Conſecrated by the Devotions of Holy Prieſts, who celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Obſequies according to the Primitive Chriſtian Uſage, by making Oblations for him, and offering the moſt Holy Sacrifice for the Refreſhment of his Soul, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> who liv'd not long after, deſcribes the manner or Antient Chriſtian Burial, and juſtly chargeth Biſhop <hi>Martialis, With Burying the Children of this</hi> Donaldus <hi>in the prophane Sepulchres of the</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.

            </p>
            <p>In the year of Grace 221. <hi>Pope Zephyrin</hi> dy'd, and was ſucceeded by <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> in whoſe time, one <hi>Cadorus</hi> is ſaid to be Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> a Virtuous Prince, no Enemy to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which ſome conceive to have been profeſs'd by his Mother <hi>Mammaea,</hi> was in the 14th. year of his reign ſlain by the Treaſon of <hi>Julius Maximinus,</hi> who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his place: When <hi>Maximinus</hi> began his reign, Chriſtian Religion flouriſh'd, not only in the <hi>Southern</hi> parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> but among the <hi>Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> alſo, where reign'd <hi>Chrathilintus</hi> a Chriſtian Prince, Succeſſor of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldus,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:96414:16"/>he was inſtructed by <hi>Amphibalus;</hi> returning about this time from <hi>Rome,</hi> (as ſome ſay.) At this time St. <hi>Pontianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> govern'd the Church of God. Now the Tyrant <hi>Maximinus</hi> raiſing the ſixth Perſecution, ſharpen'd it eſpecially againſt Biſhops and Teachers of the Chriſtian Faith; by his command St. <hi>Pontianus</hi> ſuffer'd Martyrdom, being beaten to death with Clubs: To him ſucceeded St. <hi>Antherus</hi> a <hi>Graecian</hi> born, who the year following was likewiſe put to Death by the ſame Tyrant <hi>Maximinus,</hi> who was ſlain in his fourth year, and the Holy <hi>Pope Fabianus</hi> ſate in the Chair of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and about this time, while <hi>Gordianus</hi> the younger reign'd, the Chriſtian Church enjoy'd great Tranquility, in which calm the Biſhops propagated the Faith, many Churches and Altars were erected, and no doubt in this Iſland; alſo <hi>Obinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Conanus</hi> his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, were careful to imitate the Zeal of other Biſhops: <hi>Nonnius Philippus</hi> being Governour of <hi>Britain</hi> about this time, <hi>Gordianus</hi> being in his 6th. year was ſlain by the Treaſon of <hi>Julius Philippus,</hi> who ſucceeded him; <hi>Julius</hi> himſelf was alſo ſlain by his own Guards: Howbeit, before his death, by the Grace of God, he waſh'd away his Sins by Baptiſin and Pennance; he was perſwaded to embrace Chriſtianity by St. <hi>Pontianus,</hi> a man of high Dignity; yet becauſe <hi>Philip</hi> was known to be guilty of many Crimes, he was not preſently permitted to enter the Church, until he had modeſtly conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeended to place himſelf among the Penitent, and confeſs'd his ſins with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent fear, and Pious affection.</p>
            <p>Now though after the death of <hi>Lucius,</hi> no <hi>Britain</hi> generally was allow'd the Name of King, yet ſeveral Princes of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Blood exercis'd a Kingly juriſdiction, amongſt the reſt <hi>Coelus</hi> had that Title over the <hi>Trino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantes, Iceni</hi> and others, and was the Father of <hi>Helena,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Great.

            <p>
               <hi>Decius</hi> after the death of the two <hi>Philips,</hi> extended his rage to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by them Profeſs'd; in whoſe time many Glorious Martyrs, amongſt the reſt St. <hi>Fabianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſeal'd the firmneſs of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with their Blood, although ſome redeem'd themſelves from Sacrificing to Idols, obtain'd Libels, falſely declaring they had Sacrific'd, and from thoſe Libels were call'd <hi>Libellatici Lapſi,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> as they well deſerv'd. When afterwards St. <hi>Cornelius</hi> poſſeſs'd St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, the <hi>Novatian</hi> Hereſie aroſe, <hi>Novatus</hi> an <hi>African</hi> was the Author of it, who coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> link'd himſelf with <hi>Novatianus,</hi> ſwelling with envy againſt the Election of St. <hi>Cornelius:</hi> They excluded the <hi>Libellatici</hi> and other Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals from all hope of Pardon, though they ſubmitted themſelves to due Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. <hi>Gildas</hi> calls this <hi>Novatus, A black Swine, who trod under-foot our Lords Pearl.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> concerning the followers of <hi>Novatus,</hi> bids us, <hi>Beware of thoſe, who deny the Church of God Power to forgive all ſins, and will not underſtand how in St.</hi> Peter <hi>God hath eſtabliſh'd a Rock, and given the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven to his Church.</hi> Theſe are they which boaſt themſelves to be <hi>Cathari,</hi> more pure than the Doctrine of Chriſt requires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Decius</hi> being betray'd and ſlain, was ſucceeded by <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Voluſianus,</hi> and by their Cruelty St. <hi>Lucius</hi> who ſucceeded St. <hi>Cornelius</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> See, was Crown'd with Martyrdom; theſe Emperors were ſoon ſlain by their own Souldiers, and were ſucceeded by <hi>Valerianus</hi> and his Son <hi>Gallienus:</hi> In the beginning of whoſe reign, <hi>Stephanus</hi> the Succeſſor of St. <hi>Lucius</hi> in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96414:16"/>the Apoſtolick See, inſtructed, Baptiz'd and Ordain'd St. <hi>Mallo</hi> or <hi>Melanius,</hi> a glorious Ornament of our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation: He was ſent out of <hi>Britain</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> to pay the Emperour Tribute, where, hearing the Doctrine of the Holy <hi>Pope Stephen,</hi> he renounc'd <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and became a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and after Biſhop of <hi>Rouen</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> With St. <hi>Mallo</hi> were Baptiz'd many others by this <hi>Pope:</hi> After he had Catechiz'd them, and appointed a Faſt, and examin'd their Faith: It is obſervable by how Stupendious a Miracle St. <hi>Mallo</hi> came to be deſign'd Biſhop of <hi>Rouen;</hi> whilſt on a certain day St. <hi>Stephen</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> was celebrating <hi>Maſs,</hi> both He and St. <hi>Mallo</hi> ſaw an Angel ſtanding at the right ſide of the <hi>Altar,</hi> when <hi>Maſs</hi> was finiſh'd, the Angel having a Croſier or Paſtoral Staff in his hands, gave it to St. <hi>Mallo,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Receive this Staff, with which thouſhalt govern the Inhabitants of the City of</hi> Rouen; <hi>and though the Labours of a courſe of life yet unexperienc'd by thee, may prove burdenſom, fear not yet to undertake it, for our Lord Jeſus Chriſt will protect thee under the ſhadow of his wings:</hi> St. <hi>Mallo</hi> in his journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rouen</hi> at <hi>Auxerre</hi> in <hi>Gaul,</hi> having in his hand the Staff given him by the Angel, by his fervent Prayer reſtor'd to Health a man whoſe foot was cut in two pieces by an Axe: No ſooner was St. <hi>Mallo</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Rouen,</hi> but he began to Preach the Name of Chriſt to the Inhabitants, with ſuch efficacy of Speech, and Power of Miracles, enforc'd by the Sanctity of his Life, that in ſhort time he brought the whole City to the obedience of Chriſt. This great change is ſaid to be wrought, eſpecially at a time when moſt of the People were Aſſembled to perform an abominable Sacrifice to one of their falſe Deities; for St. <hi>Mallo</hi> coming amongſt them, enflam'd with a Heavenly Zeal, reprov'd their Stupidity, in Worſhiping a Senſeleſs Stock for a God: He calls upon the Name of Chriſt, makes the triumphant ſign of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> immediately down tumbles the Idol in the ſight of them all, ſo that with the word of his mouth alone, he broke it in pieces, and by this means a great multitude thus aſtoniſh'd, receiv'd his inſtruction, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd the Doctrine of Faith, and were Purify'd by the Water of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>In the ſame place from whence this Saint thus expell'd the Divel, he built a Church in Honour of the Holy Trinity, where the People Aſſembled every <hi>Sunday,</hi> and were inſtructed in the perfect Worſhip of God, where the unbloody Sacrifice was offer'd, and the means of attaining Salvation were Communicated: He alſo built there other Churches for the like Holy purpoſes; and having begotten many thouſand Souls to Chriſt in the year of Grace 280. ended his Life and Labours, and departed to his Eternal reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valerian</hi> at firſt ſeeming to favour the Chriſtians, raiſeth afterwards the 8th. Perſecution againſt them, wherein the Holy <hi>Pope</hi> S. <hi>Stephen</hi> was Crown'd with Martyrdom; him ſucceeded St. <hi>Sixtus,</hi> the ſecond of that Name, who in the ſame year taſted of the ſame Cup; and in <hi>Sixtus</hi>'s place ſate St. <hi>Dionyſius. Valerian</hi> ſoon after was taken Priſoner by <hi>Sapores</hi> King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> where he liv'd many years in Slavery, and dy'd in great miſery; his Son <hi>Gallienus</hi> ſucceeding him in the Empire, and yet never going about to redeem him; perhaps he wanted Power; for in his ſhort reign, no fewer than 30 Tyrants aſſum'd the Title of Emperour in ſeveral Provinces of the <hi>Roman</hi> World, after he had reign'd about five years Luxuriouſly and Sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, he was ſlain by the Treachery of <hi>Claudius</hi> his next Succeſſor, with his Brother and Children.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Claudius</hi> was highly eſteem'd of the <hi>Romans</hi> for his Courage, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and moral Virtues; yet was he a Perſecutor of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> After his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96414:17"/>death his Brother <hi>Quintillus</hi> for ſome few days made a buſtle as Emperour, but was ſoon ſlain by his Soldiers: Howbeit this misfortune of that <hi>Flavian</hi> Family, was in ſome ſort recompens'd, in that <hi>Criſpus</hi> another Brother of <hi>Claudius,</hi> had a Daughter call'd <hi>Claudia,</hi> Mother to <hi>Conſtantius Chlorus,</hi> who eſtabliſh'd the Empire in his Family for many Generations.</p>
            <p>Of all the late Uſurpers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, there remain'd only two when <hi>Aurelianus</hi> came to be Emperour, <hi>Zenobia</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> Queen of <hi>Palmy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene,</hi> and <hi>Tetricus</hi> in the <hi>Weſt; Aurelianus</hi> began with <hi>Zenobia,</hi> a Lady of Maſculine Courage, yet with much difficulty he ſubdu'd her, and led her in Triumph to <hi>Rome,</hi> where ſhe and her Off-ſpring liv'd in a private, but Splended Eſtate. Then march'd the Emperour againſt <hi>Tetricus,</hi> with whom alſo conſpir'd the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Army, yet he afterwards ſurrender'd himſelf to the Emperour, and was not only permitted to live, but intruſted with Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. In this Expedition, <hi>Aurelianus</hi> was accompany'd with <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Chlorus,</hi> who here laid the foundation of bringing the Empire into his own Family; for by his Courage and Conduct in relieving <hi>Ausburg,</hi> and deſeating the <hi>Germans</hi> who Beſieg'd it, he gain'd ſuch favour from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that he was truſted with an Army into <hi>Britain,</hi> then unquiet and diſ-affected; yet did <hi>Conſtantius</hi> ſo well proſper there, that he Married the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Lady St. <hi>Helenae,</hi> and laid the grounds of ſtrange Revolutions, not only in his own Family, but in the Church of God; For now it was that the Glorious Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great was born, and Educated by his Holy Mother, at leaſt in the love of Chriſtianity, if not in the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it; ſo as in a few years, the Catholick Church was by him, not only freed from Perſecution, but made to triumph over <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatry, and the Kingdom of Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi> having broach'd a moſt execrable <hi>Hereſie,</hi> by which he deny'd the Divinity of the Son of God, was in a Synod of <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Biſhops reduc'd from his Error; But upon his relapſe was Excommunicated and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd from his Biſhoprick of <hi>Antioch:</hi> This Arch-Heretick refuſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh his See, the Biſhops gave an account of his Obſtinacy to <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> The Emperour <hi>Aurelianus</hi> was deſir'd to pronounce Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence therein, who in a manner like a Chriſtian Decreed, <hi>That the poſſeſſion of the ſaid Biſhoprick, ſhould be given to ſuch, to whom the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>and other</hi> Weſtern <hi>Biſhops ſhould aſſign it;</hi> And ſo <hi>Paulus</hi> was utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd from his Church.</p>
            <p>Two Voyages of <hi>Conſtantius Chlorus</hi> are mention'd in Story; The firſt, in the fourth year of <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s reign, he was then only a Senator, or Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, but ſent with an Army to reclaim the <hi>Britains,</hi> who were too apt to adhere to ſuch Tyrants who Uſurp'd the Empire, yet was with all quietneſs receiv'd as the Emperour's Lieutenant; his Voyage into <hi>Britain</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous, Victory rather expected him there, then accompany'd him thither, he made himſelf welcom by his Mercy and Clemency, in forbearing to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult over his Conquer'd Enemies, by his Juſtice in awarding reſtitution to ſuch as were Pillag'd, by his Providence in gaining the Affections of the Inhabitants, by giving liberty to the Captives, and forbearing to puniſh Offenders, and winning them to Repentance. He apply'd himſelf more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to <hi>Coelus</hi> before-nam'd, and entring into a firm League with him, Eſpous'd his Daughter <hi>Helena,</hi> not long after which Marriage <hi>Coelus</hi> dy'd, and <hi>Constantius</hi> in the right of his Wife, became poſſeſs'd of her Fathers Principality. The year after this happy Marriage, and as a Bleſſed effect
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96414:17"/>thereof, was born <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great; Great not only in ſubduing the Enemies of <hi>Rome,</hi> and reducing the Empire to a Peaceable and flouriſhing Eſtate, but alſo in deſtroying the Power of <hi>Satan,</hi> and advancing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God over prevailing <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this great Emperour was born in this Iſland, is acknowledg'd and prov'd by the moſt credible Authors; the particular place of his Birth is more queſtion'd, ſome ſay it was <hi>York,</hi> ſome <hi>London,</hi> but moſt think <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> where <hi>Helena</hi> and her <hi>Father</hi> uſually reſided; that Town being girt with a Wall at the Coſts of <hi>Helena.</hi> Some <hi>Greek</hi> Authors will have <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to be born elſewhere; but their fancy therein hath been prov'd by the moſt Learn'd and Impartial Authors fond and improbable, eſpecially by the Teſtimony of our Glorious Biſhop St. <hi>Adelm,</hi> who liv'd not above 300. years after <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> and in his excellent Treatiſe of Virginity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirms, <hi>That St.</hi> Helena <hi>was a</hi> Britiſh <hi>Lady;</hi> And his Treatiſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been highly extoll'd by St. <hi>Bede,</hi> gives great advantage to our Aſſertion. However St. <hi>Helena</hi> hath been diſgracefully ſpoken of by ſome Authors, as the Concubine, and not the Wife of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> yet it may be eaſily prov'd that they conſtantly Co-habited as Man and Wife, in a Lawful and Chaſte Marriage, by the unconteſted Succeſſion of <hi>Constantine</hi> their Son in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and by other undenyable Teſtimonies: And <hi>Barronius</hi> concludes, <hi>We are of neceſſity compell'd to agree, that</hi> Helena <hi>was the Lawful Wife of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius: Inſomuch as the Emperour <hi>Justinian</hi> made a Decree in her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, wherein he ſets forth, <hi>How much ſhe was Honour'd by her Pious Son</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>and how much the Church of God hath been beholding to her, for finding our Bleſſed Saviours Croſs.</hi> True it is, that as ſome have caſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon this Holy Woman, as to her Birth, and the Lawfulneſs of her Marriage; ſo ſome alſo have queſtion'd the Integrity of her Religion: All which, notwithſtanding her Birth, her Marriage, her Devotion, her Zeal and Piety in ſeaſoning her Son in Chriſtian Principles, are clearly atteſted by the ſincereſt and graveſt Authors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelianus</hi> whilſt he liv'd, was an Inhumane adverſary of Gods Truth, and rais'd the ninth Perſecution, <hi>Britain</hi> only remain'd free from Violence, under the moderate Government of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> not averſe from <hi>Chriſtianity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> After ſeven years reign <hi>Aurelianus</hi> was ſlain by his own Souldiers; him <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> ſucceeded, who dying after ſix months; <hi>Probus</hi> renown'd for Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Virtues was choſen; It is ſaid the Senate wiſh'd him, and the Army choſe him, and the People with Acclamations approv'd his Election: Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Reign, by the re-calling of <hi>Constantius,</hi> many Troubles aroſe in <hi>Britain,</hi> eſpecially from <hi>Bonoſus</hi> of <hi>Britiſh</hi> extract. <hi>Probus</hi> after five years reign, was ſlain by his own Army, and <hi>Carus Manlius Aurelius</hi> choſen in his ſtead, who created his two Sons <hi>Carinus</hi> and <hi>Numerianus Caeſarus; Carus</hi> was kill'd by Lightning, <hi>Numerianus</hi> and <hi>Carinus</hi> by Treachery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Docleſian</hi> after the Death of <hi>Carus,</hi> was pronounc'd Emperour by the Army, and prov'd the Author of the laſt, but longeſt and moſt dreadful Perſecution, that ever the Church of God ſuffer'd: <hi>Carinus</hi> being ſlain, <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian</hi> aſſum'd <hi>Maximianus</hi> as his Companion in the Empire; they conſpir'd in a reſolution to extirpate <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and defend the Adoration of their <hi>Pagan</hi> Gods: There never was given a ſtronger proof of the Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing founded upon a Rock, then the unſucceſsfulneſs of the rage of theſe two Emperours againſt it: They had the whole Power of the World in their Hands, they were eminent for Valour, Wiſdom and Policy, they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd

            <p>This Iſland of <hi>Britain</hi> divided from the World, and ſo exempted from Perſecutions, yet ſmarted under the Cruelty of theſe Bloody Emperours, and by the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Albanus,</hi> St. <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> St. <hi>Julius,</hi> St. <hi>Aaron</hi> and their Aſſociats, afforded a Glorious Example, of Conquering the World and Hell it ſelf by Faith and Patience. By all circumſtances theſe Holy Martyrs ſuffer'd about the beginning of <hi>Diocleſians</hi> reign, in the year of our Lord 286. as St. <hi>Bede</hi> expreſly teſtifies. Edicts for the perſecution of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were about this time firſt ſent into <hi>Britain,</hi> which might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps occaſion <hi>Amphibalus</hi> to return a ſecond time into his Native Country, to Convert men in the Faith of Chriſt. He is ſaid firſt to ſix at <hi>Verulam,</hi> in the Houſe of <hi>Albanus,</hi> an eminent Citizen there, and deſcended of an Illuſtrious <hi>Roman</hi> Family, and the Emperour's <hi>Questor</hi> or <hi>Treaſurer.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived St. <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> though a ſtranger to him, with great Kindneſs and Liberality; but underſtanding he was a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> privately queſtion'd him <hi>How he could paſs ſafely to that City through ſo many Regions of</hi> Gentiles? The queſtion was pertinent, and thus anſwer'd by <hi>Amphibalus, Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Son of the living God,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>preſerv'd me ſafe from all dangers, and ſent me into this Province for the Salvation of many, that by Preaching his Faith, I might prepare a People acceptable to him. Who is this Son of God,</hi> (reply'd <hi>Albanus?</hi>) <hi>Can God be ſaid to be born, theſe are ſtrange Speeches, which I never heard of before? I deſire to know your Opinion of theſe matters?</hi> The Holy man anſwer'd, <hi>Our Faith teacheth us to acknowledge the Father to be God, and the Son alſo to be God, who in Infinite Mercy vouchſafed to take our ſleſh upon him, for the Salvation of Mankind, that he might redeem us by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death.</hi> And then diſcours'd at large of the Birth, Paſſion, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Aſcention of Chriſt. Concluding, <hi>If you,</hi> O Albanus, <hi>will believe theſe things to be true, you will receive Power, by calling on the Name of Chriſt, to Cure any Infirm or Sick perſon. And the Truth is, I am come to this City on purpoſe to Preach to you, the healthful Doctrine of our Lords Paſſion, becauſe our merciful God will reward your kind Offices of Humanity and Hoſpitality, to which you frequently addict your ſelf, which is the inestimable recompenſe of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs.</hi> Then <hi>Albanus</hi> ask'd him, <hi>What Honour and Worſhip muſt I exhibit to Chriſt, in caſe I embrace the Faith?</hi> The other anſwer'd, <hi>Believe this, that our Lord Jeſus, together with the Father and the Holy Ghost, is one God, and thou wilt have perform'd a work of high esteem in his ſight.</hi> Then <hi>Albanus</hi> reply'd, <hi>What is all this; ſure thou art mad, thou know'st not what thou ſay'st? no Humane understanding or Reaſon can apprehend theſe things:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96414:18"/>But be ſure of this, that if the Inhabitants of this City come to know, thou mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

For my own part I am very ſollicitous on thy behalf, for fear ſome miſchief befall thee, before thou departeſt from hence.</hi> Having ſaid this, he went away much diſturb'd: As for St. <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> he ſpent the night alone in watching and Prayer: The ſame night a wonderful Viſion from Heaven was preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Albanus</hi> ſleeping; with which being awak'd he went to his Gueſt, and ſaid to him, <hi>Friend, if thoſe things which thou told'ſt me lately concerning Chriſt be true; I pray thee, to tell me freely the meaning of my Dream.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Me thought I ſaw a certain man come down from Heaven, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an innumerable multitude of men laid hold of him, and tormented him all the ways they could deviſe; they bound his Hands with Chains, they tore his Fleſh moſt grievouſly with Whips, they hung him on a Tree, ſtretching his Hands acroſs; he was quite naked, not having Shooes on his Feet; his Hands and Feet were faſtned to the Wood with Nails, his ſide was pierc'd through with a Spear; and from his Wound, as it ſeem'd to me, there flow'd both Blood and Water; in his right Hand they put a Reed, and on his Head they put a Crown of Thorns: And after this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Cruelty, they inſult over him with deſpiteful Speeches, ſaying to him, <hi>Hail King of the</hi> Jews, <hi>if thou art the Son of God, come down from the Croſs, and we will believe in thee:</hi> And although they continu'd a long while thus reviling him, the young man anſwer'd never a word, but at laſt cryed out with a loud voice, and ſaid, <hi>Father into thy Hands, I commend my Spirit:</hi> And ſo Expir'd; His lifeleſs Body was afterwards taken down from the Croſs, the Blood iſſuing abundantly out of it: They then laid him in a Sepulchre of ſtone, ſealing the Monument, and ſetting Guards to watch it: But then follow'd a wonderful thing, for the Bloodleſs Carcaſs return'd to Life, and re-ſuming former ſtrength, came out of the Sepulchre Seal'd as aforeſaid: I my ſelf with my own Eyes, ſaw him how he roſe again. Then came from Heaven certain men cloath'd with Veſtments white as Snow, and taking the Man with them, return'd from whence they came, attended by an infinite number of others in like Garments, which all the way ceas'd not to ſing Praiſes, Bleſſing the Father. I not knowing who he was, with his Son, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed be God the Father, with his only begotten Son.</hi> They expreſs'd ſuch wonderful joy, as nothing could be compar'd to it: Theſe things I ſaw, with many others, which I neither will, or ought to declare; I beſeech thee tell me what is ſignify'd by theſe things thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to me; fear not any danger to your ſelf, but ſpeak freely?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Holy man <hi>Amphibalus</hi> having heard this, ſenſibly felt his Heart vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by our Lord with all joy, and preſently taking out a Crucifix, which he had about him ſecretly, ſaid to <hi>Albanus, Behold in this Figure and Image thou may'ſt manifeſtly perceive, the meaning and importance of thy laſt nights Viſion; for the Man which came from Heaven is this Jeſus my Lord, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd not to undergo the puniſhment of the Croſs, that by his Blood, he might free us from the guilt, which we had contracted, by the Tranſgreſſion of our first Father</hi> Adam. <hi>Now theſe men which laid violent hands upon him, and ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted him, were his own People the</hi> Jews: <hi>For though they had a promiſe from God, that he would ſend unto them from Heaven his own Son; yet when He whom they ſo much, and ſo long expected, was come, they would not acknowledge him, to be the Author of their Salvation, but contradicted him in every thing; return'd to him Evil for Good, and Hatred for his Love. And at last ſtir'd up
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96414:19"/>with extream envy and malice against him, they broke out into ſuch horrible Impiety, that they laid hold on him, Crucify'd and Murder'd him. Thus it was that our Lord redeem'd us with the price of his own Blood: Thus by Dying he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came victorious over death; For being rais'd upon the Croſs, he drew all to him; for deſcending voluntarily to the encloſures of Hell, he freed from captivity his own Servants detain'd there, and binding the Divel in everlasting Chains, he caſt him into utter darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Albanus</hi> fill'd with wonder, broke out in theſe words, <hi>All that thou haſt ſaid of Christ is most true; for the laſt night I evidently perceiv'd, and with mine own eyes ſaw, how Chriſt overcame the Divel, how he bound him, and thrust him down into the bottom of Hell, where the damnable wretch lyes faſt bound with Chains: So that knowing what hath been told by thee is true, from this moment I profeſs, I will be thy moſt obedient Diſciple. Tell me therefore, for I know thou art Ignorant of nothing, how I muſt behave my ſelf to the Father and Holy Ghost, now that I profeſs my ſelf a ſervant of the Son? Amphibalus</hi> at this queſtion, gave thanks to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for that <hi>Albanus</hi> of himſelf had the knowledge to pronounce thoſe three Adorable Names, and bid him, <hi>believe firmly, and profeſs faithfully, that thoſe three perſons ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by him in their proper Names, are one only God. I believe,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Albanus) and my firm Faith is, that there is no other God, beſides my Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ, who for the Salvation of Mankind, took our Nature upon him, and ſuffer'd death upon the Croſs. He, together with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, is one only God, and beſides him there is no other.</hi> And having ſaid this, he often caſt himſelf Proſtrate before the Crucifix, as if he had ſeen our Lord Jeſus himſelf hanging on the Croſs, carneſtly begging Pardon for his ſins: He often affectionately kiſs'd his Saviours feet and places of his Wounds, as if he had ſeen him Crucify'd; Tears with Blood flow'd abundantly from his Eyes upon the venerable Croſs, and theſe words from his mouth, <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Divel, and deteſt all the Enemies of our Lord, to whom I wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign myſelf. Amphibalus</hi> then bad him be of good Courage, ſaying, <hi>Our Lord is with thee, whoſe Grace will never be wanting to thee: The ſaving Faith which others attain by the Miniſtry of men, thou haſt learn'd by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Chriſt himſelf; And therefore being aſsur'd of thy constancy, my purpoſe is to leave thee, and Travel further, that I may ſhew the way of Truth to other</hi> Gentiles <hi>alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Albanus</hi> prevail'd with him, to ſtay a week longer, that he might be more perfectly inſtructed in the Faith by him. This Narration of St. <hi>Alban</hi>'s Converſion, is atteſted by a very Antient and Credible Author: We ſhall now proceed to the Hiſtory of his glorious Martyrdom.</p>
            <q>
               <p>He having been thus Inſtructed, Baptiz'd and Confirm'd in the Faith by <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> was at laſt contented with his departure, but exhorted him to take care of his ſafety; and in order thereunto, diſguis'd him in his own Military Veſtment, woven with Gold, that he might the more ſafely paſs through the Soldiers: Early in the morning <hi>Amphibalus</hi> takes his ſlight <hi>Northward,</hi> conducted part of the way by <hi>Albanus;</hi> at laſt they parted with Tears, <hi>Amphibalus</hi> haſtens into <hi>Wales. Albanus</hi> returns into the City, cloath'd with the <hi>Caracalla,</hi> or long Eccleſiaſtical Robe of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibalus,</hi> and now left alone made great haſt in his journey to Immortality: All the enticements of the World became odious to him, he found no pleaſure but in Prayers and Tears at the foot of our Lords Croſs; he burn'd with a deſire to requite the Love of Chriſt by dying for him. His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96414:19"/>and Neighbours obſerving the wonderful change in his manner of Life, began to ſuſpect, and quickly found out the true cauſe of it; ſo that in a ſhort time he is publickly known for a Deſerter of <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore complain'd of unto, and conven'd before the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrate, to whom a certain <hi>Gentile</hi> had diſcover'd what ever paſs'd between St. <hi>Albanus</hi> and St. <hi>Amphibalus;</hi> This Magiſtrate thus Incens'd commanded they ſhould both be brought before him; St. <hi>Amphibalus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing departed, the Soldiers found only St. <hi>Albanus</hi> in his ſtrange Habit, at his Prayers with naked feet before the Croſs of our Lord, and ask'd him, <hi>where the Clark was, whom he had entertain'd?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>That the Holy man was under the Protection of God, and fear'd not the Threats of Men:</hi> When they heard this, they laid hands on him, bound him with Chains, and violently drew him away, ſome pulling at his Garments, ſome at his Hair: He had ſtill upon him the Veſtment of his Maſter, knowing the ſight of it was enough to make him odious; he carried alſo in his hand the Image of our Lord, that he might only appear a Servant of the <hi>Croſs:</hi> Being come before the Judge, he was examin'd in many particulars, but all his Anſwer was, <hi>That he was</hi> Albanus, <hi>and a Chriſtian;</hi> which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd with great liberty of Speech: The Judge enquir'd of him, <hi>What became of the Clark who was ſent by one call'd Christ, to delude and ſeduce the People of this City. Had he not</hi> (ſaith the Judge) <hi>had a guilty Conſcience, and been diſtruſtful of his own Cauſe, this worthy Maſter of yours, would have freely preſented himſelf before us, to defend both Himſelf and his Diſciples; But by his own Carriage, he makes known the falſeneſs and Fraudulence of his Doctrine, ſince he deſerts thee, and is Cowardly run away from thee; whom, if his Cauſe had been good, he ought to have juſtify'd, though with hazard of his Life: So as I ſuppoſe thou now perceiv'st how ſilly a Fellow he was, who ſeduc'd thee into Errours, and brought thee by his idle ſuggestions into ſuch a Frenzy, as not only to renounce all worldly Advantages, but to contemn the immortal Gods; the injury againſt whom, ſince we ought not to leave unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, my purpoſe was to have reveng'd it by the death of the prophane Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: But ſeeing humane frailty is ſuch, that there is none, but are obnoxious to Errour, thou mayest yet by Repentance eſcape the indignation of the Gods, and make them propitious to thee, if thou wilt now renounce this abominable Sect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hereto Albanus</hi> Anſwer'd, <hi>It were a very eaſie matter to declare how vain and impertinent this long diſcourſe of yours is; for if it had ſeem'd good or agreeable to either of us; That Holy Clark would not have fail'd to have been here: But I confeſs his ſtay here could not be pleaſing to me, who well know how prone to miſchief this People hath ever been: The Doctrine taught by that good man, I have heartily embrac'd, neither can I repent me of it; for the Faith which I profeſs will be prov'd to be Holy and Divine, by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Sick and Infirm People, who by virtue thereof ſhall receive Health. I will no longer Sacrifice to your Gods, nor fear your Threats or Torments, being ſecure under the protection of my good Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being ſaid, at the command of the Judge, he was Cruelly Scourg'd by the Officers for refuſing to Sacrifice; during which Torment, he lifted up his Eyes to our Lord, and with a chearful countenance ſaid, <hi>O Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I beſeech thee keep this mind and good reſolution, which thou haſt given me, firm and ſtable: My deſire is, O my God, to offer up my Soul a whole Burnt Sacrifice to thy Glory, and with my Blood to Seal thy Truth.</hi> But when the Officers were weary with tormenting him, the Holy man was
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96414:20"/>thruſt into a deep Dungeon, where he continu'd ſix Months. All the Elements ſoon bare witneſs of the injury done unto him; and from the time of his Apprehenſion to his Death, neither Rain nor Dew refreſh'd the Earth, the Winds were whiſt, and the Region thereabout parch'd with exceſſive Heat of the Sun, even in the night-time the ſtifing heat was intollerable, neither Fields nor Trees produced any Fruit, ſo that the whole World fought in the quarrel of this juſt man againſt his Impious Enemies; inſomuch as this exceſſive Heat and Drought, <hi>Heathens</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves took notice of, though they apply'd it to other purpoſes.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <q>The <hi>Infidel</hi> Judge expected that the Conſtancy of the Holy Martyr would have been broken and ſpent, by a tedious and painful Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereas on the contrary, his ſolitude, which gave him opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to unite himſelf to God by Prayer, increas'd and ſtrengthned his Courage.</q> The Author of his Life hath thus exemplify'd one of his Prayers, <hi>O Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, do not permit the Divels malice ſo much to prevail, as by his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing machinations, and this Peoples relenting, my ſuffering for thee may be hindred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Not long after being come out of Priſon to ſuffer, and addreſſing his Speech to the unbelieving People, who flock'd to ſee him, he told them, <hi>He was an irreconcilable Enemy of their Falſe Gods, the works of mens Hands, unworthy of Honour, as having no Divinity, they themſelves could not but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that theſe their Idols, neither See, Hear nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand any thing, and that it could be no other then deteſtable vanity to expect Life from them which have no Life, to pray to thoſe who could not Hear, to expect ſafety or Happineſs from them, which were not ſenſible of the leaſt good to themſelves: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proteſts, that whoever Honours ſuch dead Idols, muſt renounce all reaſon, for whom can be more deſperately miſcrable, than he who ſuffers himſelf to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlav'd to Puppets of his own faſhioning. Wo therefore to Idels, but greater Wo to their Adorers.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>From hence may eaſily be obſerv'd, that this Holy Martyr who thus ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly inveighs againſt Idolatry, yet with great Devotion Venerates the <hi>Croſs</hi> of our Lord, ſo far is the reſpect and Honour given by the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> to Sacred things from any taint of Idolatry: And <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apology for <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> teſtifies, <hi>That although they Ador'd the</hi> Croſs, <hi>yet Idols, and all their Ornaments were deteſted by them, and abominable unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>When theſe invectives againſt Idols were utter'd by St. <hi>Alban,</hi> Sentence of Death was pronounc'd againſt him, and he was led to Execution, to a place call'd <hi>Holmburſt,</hi> a Plain cloath'd with all ſorts of Flowers, a fit Theater for ſo Glorious a Martyr: <hi>Albanus</hi> being thus led to his Death, came to a River, which with a ſwift Torrent ran between a Wall on the one ſide, and a Sandy-ſhore on the other, where the Holy Martyr was to be Beheaded; there he ſaw great multitudes of all Conditions, Ages and Sects, which no doubt by Divine inſtinct, were aſſembled to Honour his Death; and they ſo choak'd the paſſage of the Bridge, that before night they could not all have paſs'd over: As for the Judge, he had no intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any reſpect to the Martyr, but ſtay'd behind in the City. St. <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> therefore enflam'd with a Devout deſire of a ſpeedy Martyrdom, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd near the River, and lifting up his Eyes with Prayer to God, the River became preſently dry, ſo as the Water gave free way to the paſſengers, by the Prayer of the Martyr to this effect, <hi>O Lord Jeſus Chriſt, from whoſe moſt Holy ſide, I my ſelf, in a Viſion, ſaw both Water and Blood
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96414:20"/>to flow; I beſeach thee, to cauſe theſe Waters to be diminiſh'd, and the floud to return back, that the People without prejudice or danger, may be preſent at my Sufferings.</hi> He had no ſooner pray'd thus, but the Channel was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately dry, his Tears left no other water in the River, the Power of his Prayer emptied the Torrent and clear'd a ſafe paſſage for the People.</p>
               <p>The Officer who conducted St. <hi>Alban</hi> to his Death, by the merits of the Holy Martyr obtain'd Eternal Happineſs; for ſeeing the Miracles, he threw away his Sword, and caſting himſelf at the Holy Martyr's feet, beg'd his pardon; which when the People ſaw, they laid hold on the Man, beat out his Teeth, and in a manner broke all his Bones. This <hi>Pagan</hi> Souldier thus of a Perſecutor, chang'd into a Lover of the true Faith, and willing to die for and with St. <hi>Alban,</hi> the other Officers were at a ſtand and knew not what to do.</p>
            </q>
            <p>It is further related, <q>That the Holy Martyr aſcending the Hill, the People at the top thereof, were tormented with extremity of Thirſt; the Martyr kneeling down Pray'd to God, <hi>The People might receive no harm by his occaſion;</hi> Upon which brake preſently forth a Fountain at his Feet, and with a rapid courſe flow'd down the Hill, ſo that all the Peoples Thirſt was ſatisfi'd. In the mean time another Executioner was appointed, who to his great Unhappineſs diſcharg'd that Impious Office, and with his Sword cut off the Holy Martyr's Head kneeling in Prayer to God, and Kiſſing the <hi>Crucifix</hi> which he held in his Hand: And immediately, O wonderful! Almighty God by the ſuddain loſs of this Executioners Eyes, teſtified the Holy Martyr's Innocence; for together with the Martyr's Head, thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſeleſs Eyes ſell to the ground.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>With St. <hi>Alban</hi> the poor Converted Souldier was alſo Beheaded, who by Divine Inſtinct refus'd to put the Holy Confeſſor to Death; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, though this new Convert was not outwardly cleanſed with the water of Baptiſm, yet being waſh'd in the Laver of his own Blood, he became wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be admitted into the Kingdom of Heaven. His Name is ſaid to be <hi>Heraclius;</hi> of whom it is further reported, That being left half dead, by the Peoples Stroaks, as aforeſaid, and creeping on his hands and feet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Crowd, he was mock'd by one of the Judges, <hi>And bid to addreſs himſelf to his Patron</hi> Albanus, (then newly Executed) <hi>and Pray him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore Soundneſs to his bruis'd Limbs; Run,</hi> (ſaith the Scoffing Judge) <hi>make haſt, joyn thy Patrons Head to his Body; no doubt, thou wilt not fail of Health; Bury the dead Carcaſs, and thou may'ſt be ſure, whilſt it is in thy Hands it will afford a Cure.</hi> The Souldier reply'd, <hi>I do verily believe, that this bleſſed Saint by his merits, can reſtore unto me my perfect Health: So that what you ſpeak in Deriſion, may in earneſt be fulfill'd to me.</hi> Having ſaid this, he imbrac'd the Martyr's Head, and adjoyning it to the Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came immediately ſound. When the <hi>Infidels</hi> ſaw this, they were fill'd with Envy, and bound him with Chains, tearing his Body with ſeveral ſorts of Tortures, and in the end cut off his Head.</p>
               <p>How acceptable to Almighty God theſe Martyrdoms were, was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declar'd from Heaven in a wonderful manner; for behold, the night following their Sufferings, a Pillar of Light was ſeen to raiſe it ſelf from the Grave of St. <hi>Alban</hi> up to Heaven, by which Angels aſcended and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, ſpending the whole night in Hymns and Praiſes to God, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo theſe words, <hi>The Illuſtrious</hi> Albanus <hi>is now a glorious Martyr of Chriſt.</hi> As <hi>Venantius</hi> in his Poem for that purpoſe Elegantly ſets forth.</p>

            <p>It will not be amiſs to ſhew here, with what Piety and Reverence <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> in all Ages behav'd themſelves to ward the Aſhes and Sacred Reliques of our Holy Martyrs: The Perſecuting <hi>Infidels</hi> knowing this well, us'd all manner of deſpight to theſe Holy Reliques, endeavouring all they could to hide or conſume them with Fire, and caſt the Aſhes before the wind. The Body of <hi>Sebaſtiane,</hi> who ſuffer'd ſoon after St. <hi>Alban,</hi> they caſt into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sink, leaſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould make him their Martyr. And again, three years after the Preſident threatn'd St. <hi>Tharacus, That he would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch him at once. but would make an end of him by piece-meal; and that the remainder of his Carcaſs ſhould be devour'd by Beaſts: Tharacus</hi> bid him, <hi>Do what he did quickly;</hi> To whom the Preſident reply'd, <hi>Thou thinkeſt Villain, that after thy death ſilly Women ſhall Embalm thy Body with Rich <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguents and Spices, but I will deſtroy thee and thy Relicks, leaſt fooliſh Women ſhould Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thee ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And concerning the Martyr <hi>Andronicus,</hi> that Preſident who condemned him, Decreed, <hi>He ſhould be conſum'd to Aſhes, leaſt ſome of his Conſorts, or fooliſh Women, ſhould gather up any of them and preſerve them, as if they were ſome precious or holy Thing:</hi> Yet for all this, when ſome Devout <hi>Chriſtians</hi> endeavoured to find their Aſhes by night, mingled and confounded with other Malefactors, three bright Torches, like Stars appeared over their Bodies, and conducted thoſe Devout <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to diſcover thoſe Aſhes and Reliques, and decently to inter them. This was the practice of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in thoſe days, but condemn'd by the <hi>Manicheans</hi> as Superſtitious: St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> confutes their Errour, by diſtinguiſhing the Veneration due to Saints, which he calls <hi>Doulia,</hi> from the ſupream Degree of Adoration due only to God, which he terms <hi>Latria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Gildas</hi> having thus related the Martyrdom of our Proto-Martyr St. <hi>Alban,</hi> ſhews what a change happen'd in <hi>Britain</hi> nine years after, when the fury of this Perſecution ceas'd, <hi>For then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all the devout Soldiers of Chriſt, with joyful Eyes beheld and receiv'd the Calm and Lightſomneſs follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo tedious a Winters-night.</hi> Then they began to reſtore demoliſh'd Churches, they new founded Sacred Temples, Conſecrated to the Honour
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96414:21"/>of Holy Martyrs; theſe they Adorn, and in them Celebrate publick Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities and Pure Sacrifices, as manifeſt Trophies after their Victory: This Happy change began ſoon after the Tyrants <hi>Carauſius</hi> and <hi>Alectus</hi> were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd by <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> who in the year of Grace 292. was Created <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and receiv'd the Government of <hi>Britain. Gregory</hi> the Great was not then the firſt who brought into <hi>Britain</hi> the Cuſtom of Dedicating Churches to the Honour of Martyrs; for <hi>Germanus</hi> and <hi>Lupus,</hi> before the Entrance of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> came into this Iſland, there to root out the <hi>Pelagian Hereſy,</hi> and found here Erected to the Honour of St. <hi>Alban,</hi> in the place where by ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Blood he ſo Triumph'd, a Famous Church, which with great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion he Viſited, and there pay'd his Thanks to God, for his Victory over the <hi>Pelagian Hereſy:</hi> He open'd the Holy Martyr's Sepulchre, and as an Honour to him, Repos'd in it, ſeveral Reliques of Apoſtles and Martyrs, which he brought over out of <hi>France</hi> with him; and becauſe he would not depart, without the Holy Martyr's protection, he took a lump of Earth from the place where the Martyr's Blood was ſhed; and at his return into <hi>France,</hi> carry'd it to his own See, from whence the Veneration of St. <hi>Alban</hi> ſpread it ſelf over all <hi>France,</hi> and after into <hi>Germany</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>By a conteſt between the <hi>Monks</hi> of St. <hi>Alban</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the II's. time, it is put out of doubt, that the Body of this Holy Martyr was Bury'd at St. <hi>Albans;</hi> for the <hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Ely</hi> contending before that King, that the ſaid Martyrs Body lay among them; the King commanded his pretended Tomb there ſhould be open'd; which being done, nothing was found in it, but a courſe Hair-garment, ſprinkled with Blood in the upper part of it, as freſh as if it had been lately ſhed, which Garment queſtionleſs was the <hi>Caracalla</hi> before-mention'd: It is no wonder this poor Garment ſhould with Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be preſerv'd by theſe <hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Ely,</hi> for God hath declar'd this to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him by many Miracles, witneſs St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> who hath thus written, <hi>That a little portion of Duſt, a particle of Bones, a little Hair, part of the Vestment, the ſprinkl'd marks of a Martyr's Blood, ought to have as much Veneration as the whole Body:</hi> He adds further, <hi>That he had known where only the Name of a Martyr attributed to a place, had produc'd the ſame Virtue, that his whole Body would have done;</hi> and then he cryes out, <hi>O won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful! the Memory alone of a Martyr is ſufficient in my Opinion to confer Health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt that here follow'd St. <hi>Alban</hi> in his rough way of Martyrdom, was St. <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> who firſt ſhew'd him the way to Heaven: The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of St. <hi>Alban,</hi> the Miracles before and after his Death ſtir'd up divers, of thoſe who were Spectators of his Death, or amaz'd with the wonders which accompany'd it, to abandon their Idols, and ſeek out St. <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> that from his Lips the Doctriue of Chriſt might be inſtill'd into their Hearts; To that purpoſe they undertook a journey into <hi>Wales,</hi> where they found him Preaching the Word of Life, to the people of that Region; to him they preſented the <hi>Croſs</hi> which he had given to his Diſciple St. <hi>Alban,</hi> and which was ſprinkled with his freſh Blood, and ſo was a manifeſt token of his late Martyrdom; and upon which St. <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> after he had given Thanks to God, made a Sermon of Chriſtian Religion to his Auditors, in number about 1000. who having heard the Sermon embrac'd his Doctrine, and chearfully receiv'd from his Sacred Hands, as a Seal of their Faith, the Holy Baptiſm: The departure of ſo great a Multitude from <hi>Verulam,</hi> rais'd ſo great an Animoſity againſt thoſe Deſerters of their Religion and City in the Hearts of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> that they reſolv'd to purſue them with Arm'd Forces,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96414:22"/>hoping to find <hi>Amphibalus</hi> in their Company, which they ſoon did, and took him in his uſual Office of Preaching to his new Converts: Such was their rage, that without diſtinction of Sex or Age, they Mercileſly put all their Countrey-men to the Sword, Neighbours, murdering Neighbours; Friends, Friends; and Kinſmen, Kinſmen; and all of them ruſhing with violence upon <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> they check him, <hi>With deceiving the People, and teaching them to trample under-foot the Laws Imperial, and contemn the Gods,</hi> Of which Reproaches the Holy Man takes no notice, but with joy recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the Souls of his Murder'd Converts unto the living God.</p>
            <p>Where the place of this Slaughter was, is uncertain, ſome ſay amongſt the <hi>Silures,</hi> others ſay at <hi>Litchfield,</hi> lying in the way from <hi>Verulam</hi> towards <hi>Wales;</hi> where-ever it was, St. <hi>Amphibalus</hi> was from thence driven on his bare feet, with his Arms ſtrait bound, back again to <hi>Verulam;</hi> by the way, although thus Hamper'd, he had yet the Power to looſe a Sick perſon from the bands of his Infirmity, <hi>Calling upon him for help, and declaring that he firmly believ'd, his Health ſhould be reſtor'd unto him, if</hi> Amphibalus <hi>the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the moſt high God, would vouchſafe to intercede for him in the Name of Chriſt.</hi> Which he ſoon did, and behold in the ſight of them all the ſick perſon immediately aroſe perfectly recover'd.</p>
            <p>When the Holy man, after his tedious and painful journey, came to the Confines of <hi>Verulam,</hi> his Cruel Perſecutors ſtrip'd him of his Garments, and faſtning a Stake in the ground, they with a Sword rip'd up his Belly, and tying the end of his Guts about the Stake, with Cruel Whipping, they forc'd the Holy Martyr to walk about it, and ſo enwrap it with his Bowels; and yet not content with this Cruelty, they Inhumanely mangled the reſt of his Body with Knives and Lances. The man of God all this while ſtood with a chearful Countenance, as if he had ſuffer'd nothing, the more he was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd, the more conſtant he appear'd; when the wonder was, he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main yet alive: This conſtancy of his ſtir'd up many of the Spectators to renounce their Idols, and ſubmit to the Faith of Chriſt, beſeeching the Holy man to Pray to God for them, that they might partake of Eternal Happineſs, for the obtaining whereof, they were ready to lay down their lives: The chief Magiſtrate perceiving this, commands the Officers to put all theſe new Converts to Death, which they ſoon perform'd, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of about 1000. perſons, whoſe Souls the Bleſſed Martyr in the midſt of his Tortures recommended to our Lord.</p>
            <p>One of the By-ſtanders, louder then the reſt, thus upbraided the man of God, <hi>O pityleſs wretch,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>why haſt thou deceiv'd theſe ſimple People with thy fraudulent Specehes, withdrawing them from the Worſhip of the Gods; by thy perſwaſion we have loſt our Friends and Parents: Although thou haſt above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure incens'd both Gods and Men, yet now at laſt by thy Repentance, thou may'ſt receive their Pardon and Favour: Signifie thy repentance, by renouncing that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Sect, which hitherto thou haſt follow'd, and yet adore the Omnipotent Gods, which perhaps through Ignorance thou haſt offended; which if thou wilt do, thoſe all-powerful Deities, will reſtore to Life thoſe whom thou haſt Murder'd.</hi> To whom the Holy man of God thus Anſwer'd, <hi>O</hi> Infidel, <hi>whilſt thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'ſt to extol thy Gods, aſſure thy ſelf thou offendeſt the True God; for it is Jeſus Chriſt my Lord, who alone hath Power to raiſe, and give Life to the Dead: As for thoſe whom ye Worſhip as Gods, and think them Powerful in Heaven, they now ſuffer horrible torments in Hell, with Adulterers, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt perſons, Slanderers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd ſuch as by their Reprobate actions here, render'd
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96414:22"/>themſelves like to Divels: And thou</hi> Pagan, <hi>and all ſuch as worſhip Idols, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you renounce their Worſhip, and Convert your ſelves to the Faith of Chriſt, will incur the ſame Puniſhments in Hell; But deſpair not of the Mercy of God, break off your evil ways, make haſte to partake of the Grace of Baptiſm, by which all ſins are forgiven, and Heaven is open'd unto men, thereby becoming new Creatures, diveſted of their former wicked diſpoſitions; For thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſm by their ſins were the Children of the Divel, become afterwards the Sons of God. Run therefore to this Grace for refuge, that you may eſcape ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Torments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe Speeches the <hi>Infidels</hi> were ſo enrag'd that they labour'd with all their force to diſpatch the Holy Martyr with multitudes of Stones, who ſtill remain'd unmoveable in Prayer, not ſtiring any way from the place where he ſtood: But the hour approaching wherein he was to ſurrender his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Spirit unto God; he lifted up his Eyes to Heaven, and ſaw our Lord Jeſus ſtanding at the right Hand of his Father, and alſo heard an Harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſort of Angels, amongſt whom he ſpy'd his Beloved Diſciple St. <hi>Alban,</hi> whoſe help and Prayer he invok'd, that God might ſend his good Angel to meet and protect him from the accurſed Fiend, who would be too ready to hinder his paſſage to Immortality. Forthwith two Angels appear'd glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſhining with Coeleſtial Splendour, and a voice was heard by all the Company, uttering theſe words, <hi>Verily I ſay unto thee, thou ſhalt be in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe with thy Diſciple:</hi> The <hi>Pagans</hi> ſtood amaz'd at this wonderful voice. And the Holy Angels took the Martyrs Soul ſhining with Brightneſs as white as Snow, and with Hymns and Praiſes carry'd it into Heaven, whilſt in the mean time the more than Barbarous Infidels ceas'd not to overwhelm his Lifeleſs Body with Stones, which afterwards a Devout Chriſtian privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took away, and carefully bury'd in <hi>Redbourn,</hi> about three Miles from <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulam;</hi> for as ſome Authors affirm, <hi>There remain'd for a long time in that Village, great Knives with which the Martyr was ſlain.</hi> And in the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt It and <hi>Verulam,</hi> a Tree ſtood enclos'd within walls, where it is thought the Poſt was fix'd, to which the Holy Martyr was tyed, and where his Bowels were torn out, or rather where his Body was bury'd, and that with ſuch Secreſie, as until the year of Grace 1178. it could never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But in that year,</hi> (as <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> writes) <hi>the Bleſſed Martyr St.</hi> Alban <hi>was ſeen viſibly to go out of the Church to him Dedicated, and came to an Inhabitant of St.</hi> Albans, <hi>whom he deſir'd to follow him: The poor man ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the brightneſs of the Martyr, was ſore afraid, but yet follow'd him</hi> North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; <hi>the very high way ſhone with the brightneſs of his Conductor: As they walk'd, the poor man ask'd, who he was? and was Anſwered,</hi> That he was St. <hi>Alban</hi> the firſt Martyr of <hi>Britain,</hi> and that he was now leading him to the Sepulchre of St. <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> by whoſe Preaching, he was Converted to our Lord, and ſo became a Martyr. <hi>They thus talk'd like Friends together, until St.</hi> Alban <hi>ſhew'd the man the place where</hi> Amphibalus <hi>was obſcurely bury'd, that his bones might be remov'd Reverently to a more Decent place; The man took diligent notice of the place, by ſetting Stones in ſuch Order there, that it might eaſily be found again; ſoon after the Sacred Body was tranſlated to the Church of St.</hi> Alban, <hi>and many Miracles were there continually wrought, through the interceſſion of the Bleſſed</hi> Amphibalus, <hi>who ſuffer'd in the year of our Lord</hi> 287.</p>
            <p>Although the place of this Saints Burial, was long obſcur'd, yet as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Gildas,</hi> his memory was precious; for within ten years after he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96414:23"/>ſuffer'd, a Church was erected to his Honour; and in the year of our Lord 309. another Church was Conſecrated to this Saint at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> which being after Re-built by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> was Dedicated to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> When the Body of this Holy Man was diſcover'd, other Bodies were found lying by it, conjectur'd to be thoſe who ſuffer'd with him.</p>
            <p>Much about this time, two famous Martyrs, <hi>Julius</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> before-mention'd, Citizens of <hi>Caerleon,</hi> and Diſciples of St. <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to have ſuffer'd for the Faith of Chriſt. Theſe two had a long time addicted themſelves to the Holy Faith, and were alſo diligent in the ſtudy of Arts and Humane Learning, both at <hi>Rome</hi> and elſe-where: <hi>They ſuffer'd</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Bede) with many others of both Sexes intoller able Torture, their Members being torn aſunder with unheard of Cruelty; at laſt conſummating a Glorious Martyrdom, their Souls were receiv'd into the joys of the Heavenly City.</hi> Their Memories were preſerv'd and Honour'd by Erecting Altars and Churches in their Names; each of them had a famous Church Erected to their Honour in <hi>Caerleon,</hi> for three Magnificent Churches are ſaid to have been Built of Old time in that City; one of the Martyrs, St. <hi>Julius,</hi> adorn'd with a Choir and Convent of Religious Virgins; a ſecond Dedicated to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Companion St. <hi>Aaron,</hi> and Graced with a Noble Choir of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; the third was the Metropolitan Church of all <hi>Cambria,</hi> and was after Tranſlated by the Holy Biſhop St. <hi>David,</hi> with the concurrence of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Legate;</hi> and all this long before the coming of the <hi>Saxons:</hi> Beſides theſe, the memory is Celebrated of two Noble <hi>Britains,</hi> Diſciples of St. <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> who ſuffer'd Martyrdom in the ſame Perſecution of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> their Names were <hi>Stephanus</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> to whoſe Honour two Churches were built in the Province of the <hi>Silures.</hi> To this time alſo is refer'd the Murdering of all the <hi>Monks</hi> in the Monaſtery of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> built by King <hi>Lucius:</hi> During the rage of this Perſecution in <hi>Britain,</hi> many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> withdrew themſelves from the fury of it, as <hi>Gildas</hi> reports; which, conſidering the frailty of Mankind, was not imprudently done; for it was thought fit, that ſuch as had not the courage to ſuſtain the weight of Martyrdom, might at leaſt hold faſt the Grace of Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>This flight of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> gave occaſion to the Perſecutors to extend their rage upon Churches and Monaſteries; all which by ſuch their rage, were ſo utterly deſtroy'd, that in this Iſland few marks remain'd of Chriſtian Religion: This Deſolation continu'd untill the Happy return of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> by whoſe Clemency, the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith and Worſhip flouriſh'd again in <hi>Britain,</hi> ſooner than in other places, <hi>Which Mercy of God,</hi> (as <hi>Bede</hi> ſaith) <hi>was the rather extended towards the</hi> Britains, <hi>becauſe they only preſerv'd among them their Primitive (Faith receiv'd in the days of King</hi> Lucius) <hi>entire and inviolate, untill the reign of</hi> Diocleſian.</p>
            <p>The Tyranny of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire againſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> God was pleas'd to revenge, by permitting another Tyrant to riſe againſt them in <hi>Britain,</hi> namely <hi>Carauſius,</hi> a man Vigilant and Active both in Councel and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Imploy'd by the Emperour to ſcowre the Seas of Pyrats. This Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment <hi>Carauſius</hi> made uſe of, rather to Enrich himſelf, than Benefit the Empire: and thereby became ſo ſuſpected, that the Emperour <hi>Maximianus</hi> commanded him to be put to Death; for the avoiding whereof, he aſſum'd the Imperial Purple, and poſſeſs'd himſelf of <hi>Britain. Maximianus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to oppoſe him, but his attempts proving vain, he was forc'd to make a Peace with <hi>Carauſius;</hi> who after ſubdu'd the <hi>Caledonian Britains,</hi> and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96414:23"/>rais'd a new Rampire to encloſe them more <hi>Northward,</hi> than any had been before, with a Triumphal Arch in memory of his Victory: He govern'd here quietly, untill the year 293. when <hi>Conſtantius</hi> made his Expedition againſt him.</p>
            <p>Now, though in the time of <hi>Carauſius,</hi> Perſecution againſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet by the Rapine of his Soldiers, moſt of the Churches and Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were deſtroy'd or Spoil'd, among the reſt thoſe of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter;</hi> the latter Converted into a Temple of <hi>Apollo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In thoſe days the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire on all ſides was greatly ſhaken, both by open Invaſions and Civil Diſſentions; to appeaſe which two new <hi>Caeſars</hi> were choſen, <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> by <hi>Maximianus;</hi> and <hi>Galerius,</hi> by <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> in whom, notwithſtanding the Supreme Authority and Majeſty of the Empire reſided; the better to ſtrengthen this Aſſociation, <hi>Diocleſian</hi> gave his Daughter <hi>Valeria</hi> to <hi>Galerius, Maximianus</hi> his Daughter <hi>Theodora</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius,</hi> who thereupon was compell'd to a Divorce from his former Wife <hi>Helena,</hi> ſo as ſhe was after eſteem'd his Concubine, or at leaſt his Wife, in the ſecond or inferior place: However, this pretended Divorce did not it ſeems prejudice their Son <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who born before in Marriage, enjoy'd his right of Primogeniture, and ſucceeded his Father in the Empire, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had other Sons by <hi>Theodora:</hi> How <hi>Helena</hi> was diſpos'd of after this Divorce, is controverted; The beſt Opinion is, that ſhe was plac'd at <hi>Triers,</hi> where <hi>Conſtantius</hi> built her a Magnificent Palace, and where ſhe was Honour'd with the Title of <hi>Auguſta:</hi> In the mean time her Son <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> was receiv'd into the Family of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and there remain'd Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infected with the Vices of the Court, in great Favour with <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Graced by him; and acceptable to all that ſaw him, for his Beauty, Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs and Modeſty, eſpecially to the beſt ſort of Men for his Virtue and Piety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantius</hi> being Created <hi>Caeſar,</hi> made an Expedition into <hi>Gaul,</hi> with intent to paſs over into <hi>Britain</hi> againſt the Tyrant <hi>Carauſius:</hi> In <hi>Gaul</hi> he took the Sea-Town <hi>Geſſoriacum</hi> or <hi>Buloign,</hi> which the Tyrant had ſtrongly Fortify'd: In the mean time <hi>Carauſius</hi> was Murder'd in <hi>Britain</hi> by a new Tyrant <hi>Alectus,</hi> General of the Forces of <hi>Carauſius; Alectus</hi> to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſſum'd, the Title of Emperour: Againſt him <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſail'd into <hi>Britain,</hi> and landed without oppoſition, though he was way-laid by a ſtrong Fleet plac'd in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> by <hi>Alectus.</hi> When he was landed, he ſet his Ships on Fire, and divided his Army; one part he led himſelf, the other he committed to the Conduct of <hi>Aſclepiodorus,</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the <hi>Praetorian Band: Alectus</hi> avoiding <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> choſe to try his Fortune with <hi>Aſclepiodorus,</hi> by whom he was eaſily defeated and ſlain: Howbeit a great part of his Army, conſiſting of Strangers, <hi>Franks</hi> and <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavians,</hi> ſeeing their Prince Dead, fled towards <hi>London,</hi> hoping to Enrich themſelves by the Spoils of that City; But <hi>Conſtantius</hi> coming on them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, preſerv'd the City, and cut thoſe Rovers in pieces; if any eſcap'd, they became Captive to the <hi>Londoners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this return of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> the poor oppreſs'd <hi>Britains,</hi> to their great joy, were freed from Slavery and ſhameful Indignities, and reſtor'd to the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, under a Prince of great Clemency, and Allied to them, by his Marriage with <hi>Helena,</hi> from whom they expected a Prince of their own Blood, young <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> then in <hi>Egypt</hi> with <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> where he gave Illuſtrious Marks of his Courage in Battels, being a very young man,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96414:24"/>and inclin'd to the <hi>Christian Faith;</hi> inſomuch as <hi>Diocleſian</hi> began to envy him, fearing leaſt he ſhould prove a deſtroyer of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Errours; and thereupon by ſubtilty deſign'd his Death, but almighty God preſerv'd him; the Tyrant no doubt, knew the young man had been nouriſh'd from his Infancy with <hi>Christian</hi> Milk, and with evil Eyes beheld what Cruelties were inflicted on the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> He was therefore watch'd and detain'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtrict Guards, and probably in danger of further miſchief.</p>
            <p>About this time he took to Wiſe <hi>Minervina,</hi> by whom he had his Eldeſt Son <hi>Criſpus.</hi> The clemency and countenance of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> encourag'd the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to repair, and new build Churches to the Honour of the Martyrs, and publickly to Celebrate the Divine Miſteries and Solemn Feſtivals, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Report of ſome <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Authors; For as <hi>Euſebius</hi> affirms, <hi>Of the four perſons conjoyn'd in the Government of the</hi> Roman <hi>World,</hi> Conſtantius <hi>only clave to the living God, and was diſpleas'd with the practices of the other three;</hi> For whereas they waſted the Churches of God, and defil'd their Provinces with the Innocent Blood of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> He on the contrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd Tranquility to his Subjects, and as an Indulgent Father allow'd them the free exerciſe of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantius</hi> after three years abode in <hi>Britain,</hi> was oblig'd to paſs over into <hi>Gaul</hi> to oppoſe a <hi>German</hi> Nation, which infeſted that Country; he was accompany'd with a great number of <hi>Britains,</hi> and with their help obtain'd a ſignal Victory.</p>
            <p>In the year 300. <hi>Stephanus</hi> the VII. Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> is ſaid to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Life by Martyrdom; not that he was put to death for the Chriſtian Religion, but for that the former Perſecution he had ſuffer'd during the rage of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> which made his Life miſerable, and might perhaps haſten his Death.</p>
            <p>In the year 302. <hi>Conſtantius</hi> ſeems to have return'd into <hi>Britain</hi> upon the Death of <hi>Aſclepiodorus,</hi> whom he left his Preſident here: Still he eſtabliſhes Peace in the Church here, whilſt in all other Provinces, Rivers of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Blood were pour'd out with great inhumanity. The Bounty, Clemency and Piety of this Prince, render'd him Admir'd and Belov'd throughout the whole Empire; the moderation of his Government, and Liberality, the mutual Affection between him and his Subjects, is declar'd by this illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Example.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Emperour</hi> Diocleſian <hi>having been inform'd, that</hi> Conſtantius <hi>by his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and profuſe Liberality, had waſted his publick Treaſure, by Meſſengers ſent on purpoſe, ſharply reprov'd him for it.</hi> Conſtantius <hi>promis'd the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in a few days to give them his Anſwer; and in the mean time gave notice throughout his Dominions, eſpecially to the moſt wealthy of his Subjects, that he ſtood in great need of Money, and that they could never have a fitter opportunity to teſtifie their Affection and Duty to him: Hereupon, without any delay, and with great chearfulneſs, each contended with other, who ſhould ſend moſt; ſo that in ſhort time his Treaſure was fill'd with innumerable ſums of Money. This being done,</hi> Conſtantius <hi>invites the Meſsengers to be Spectators of his Wealth, deſiring them to tell the Emperour what they had ſeen: And when they were gone, the bountiful Emperour return'd all that Maſs of Treaſure to the reſpective Owners, with an Affectionate reſentment of their Duty and good Will to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is further related of him, <hi>That finding his Court and Family diſtracted into Faction by various Sects and Religions, he publiſh'd an Edict, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would continue in his Service, ſhould conform himſelf to the Worſhip of the</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:96414:24"/>Roman <hi>Gods, for no other ſhould ſtay in his Court; however they might enjoy their Liberty and Poſſeſſions, but they muſt avoid his preſence.</hi> This Ordinance much troubled the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> eſpecially thoſe who ambitiouſly affected world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Honour, for they preferring <hi>Mammon</hi> before God, relinquiſh'd their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to conform themſelves to <hi>Caeſars</hi> Religion: But ſeveral others, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and genuine Diſciples of Chriſt, ſhew'd themſelves willing rather to forſake their Princes, ſervice than Gods; which being obſerv'd by <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> he chaſed from his Court all thoſe faint-hearted Hypocritical Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, ſaying, <hi>They would never preſerve their Fidelity to him, who had ſo baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betray'd their Faith to God;</hi> So that he prefer'd to Dignities, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the care of his ſafety to them, whom he found conſtant. From hence it came that the <hi>Britains,</hi> who were generally <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> became Guards both to Him and other Emperours, whom they uſually encompaſs'd with long Halberts.</p>
            <p>The Faithfulneſs of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> probably mov'd <hi>Conſtantius</hi> to forſake Idolatry, and willingly to acknowledge the only true God Governour of all the World, and firmly to eſtabliſh his Authority by the Prayers and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Holy men, and ſo he paſs'd the remainder of his Life, with great Glory and Tranquility. To this happy change, no doubt but St. <hi>Helena</hi> his Wife much contributed; ſo that his Court ſeem'd little to differ from the form of a Church, in which the Miniſters and Servants of God offer'd daily Prayers and Sacrifice for him.</p>
            <p>In the year of Grace 304. the Emperours <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and <hi>Maximianus,</hi> after 20 years Reign, weary of their fruitleſs Cruelty, depos'd themſelves from the Empire: <hi>Galerius</hi> ſucceeded in the Government of the <hi>Eaſtern,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius</hi> of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire, eſpecially in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> not affecting to heap up Treaſure for himſelf, but to Enrich his Subjects.</p>
            <p>In the year 305. his young Son <hi>Constantine</hi> accompany'd <hi>Galerius</hi> in his War againſt the <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> where he undertook a ſingle Combat by the Emperour's Conſent, with their chief Leader, whom by Divine aſſiſtance he overcame, and led Priſoner to the Emperour, and ſo obtain'd Glory by that, which perhaps was intended for his Deſtruction. This year, as is Credibly reported, St. <hi>Augulus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> receiv'd the reward of his conſtant Confeſſion, having been long perſecuted for the Cauſe of Chriſt; to him ſucceeded <hi>Iltutus,</hi> or rather perhaps <hi>Reſtitutus,</hi> who aſſiſted at the firſt Councel, and ſubſcrib'd his Name thereunto.</p>
            <p>The next year, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> after he had quieted the <hi>Picts</hi> or <hi>Northern Britains,</hi> return'd to <hi>York,</hi> and there being Old, was aſſaulted by his laſt Sickneſs: The abſence of his Son <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who was detain'd in manner of a Pledge by <hi>Galerius,</hi> much afflicted him, though he had other Sons with him by <hi>Theodora,</hi> which gave him little ſatisfaction, conſidering their want of Spirit and Courage. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> obſerv'd, how much he was both fear'd and envy'd, and in danger of miſchief, whilſt he remain'd in the Emperours hands, and endeavour'd to ſecure himſelf by flight; to contrive which, with the more ſecurity, he gave command that all the publick Poſt-horſes ſhould be Kill'd, and by that means arriv'd in <hi>Britain,</hi> with ſo Proſperous a Voyage, as if he had been brought thither not by Poſt-horſes, but mounted and flying in a Heavenly Chariot: Upon his approach to his Father, he was receiv'd by him with great joy, and devout Thankſgiving to God. The dying Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was now willing to embrace death, and bequeath'd the Inheritance of the Empire to his belov'd and firſt born Son <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and ſo with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96414:25"/>comfort departed this Life. He was bury'd in the City of <hi>York</hi> with Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Solemnity, and by the <hi>Heatheniſh Romans</hi> Deify'd with the Title of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. <hi>Cambden</hi> reports, <hi>That when the Houſes of Monks there were in our Fathers memory demoliſh'd, a Lamp was found burning in a little Vaulted Chappel, in which by Tradition,</hi> Conſtantius <hi>is thought to have been bury'd.</hi> The Antients had doubtleſly an Art to maintain a flame for many Ages, by Gold diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into a kind of Oyl. Then certainly <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> muſt be miſtaken, who writes, that the Body of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was found in another place, and from thence by the then Kings command, tranſlated to <hi>Caernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von,</hi> which muſt be underſtood of ſome other <hi>Conſtantius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, notwithſtanding <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had Sons by <hi>Theodora,</hi> yet paſſing them all by, he left the Empire to his Eldeſt Son <hi>Conſtantine</hi> only, and his diſpoſal therein was Ratified by the Suffrages and Acclamations of the Army: Howbeit, ſuch was the moderation and prudent caution of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> that he contented himſelf with the Title of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> refuſing that of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> or Emperour; Inſomuch, as when the Soldiers, with great Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would have caſt on him the Imperial Purple, he ſet Spurs to his Horſe, and fled from them. In truth he had reaſon for this Caution, for though <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximianus</hi> had relinquiſh'd the adminiſtration of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; yet had they by Councels and Authority, a great influence upon the State, for by them <hi>Galerius, Maximinus</hi> and <hi>Severus,</hi> were choſen <hi>Caeſars</hi> and Succeſſors, who had poſſeſſion of <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Empire, ſo as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> being young, and at ſo great diſtance, might well think it danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, without their conſent, to aſſume the Supreme Authority.</p>
            <p>His firſt attempt therefore was, to gain the Affection and Conſent of <hi>Maximianus,</hi> from whom his Father had receiv'd the Purple Robe, and who had then a Daughter Marriageable, call'd <hi>Fauſta;</hi> Her <hi>Conſtantine</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in Marriage, preſuming the Empire ſhould be her Dowry. In the mean time, he finiſh'd his Fathers Victories in <hi>Britain,</hi> and was therein aſſiſted by King <hi>Erocas,</hi> by whoſe Councels he was much guided; afterward he paſs'd over with a great Army into <hi>France,</hi> and there ſuppreſs'd two Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Princes, who fill'd the Country with Faction, inciting the <hi>Gauls</hi> to Rebellion. Then he began to treat with <hi>Maxentius,</hi> who a year before hearing of the death of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> poſſeſs'd himſelf of <hi>Rome,</hi> and uſurp'd the Title of Emperour, by the help of the <hi>Pretorian</hi> Soldiers, and upon the hopes that <hi>Maximianus,</hi> whoſe Daughter he had Marry'd, would favour him in his Ambition, the conceit whereof made him ſlight all motions of Concord with <hi>Constantine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howbeit, <hi>Maximinian</hi> having heard of the Noble Victories and Exploits of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> beſtow'd his Daughter <hi>Fauſta</hi> upon him, and with Her the Imperial Purple. But ſoon after this Marriage, <hi>Maximinianus</hi> diſcovers his Treacherous intention to re-poſſeſs himſelf of the Empire, which he had voluntarily reſign'd, and bound himſelf by Solemn Oath in the Capital, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to reſume. This intention he firſt made known to his Daughter <hi>Fauſta</hi> before the Marriage; in purſuance whereof he Sollicits the Armies, with Promiſes of great Rewards to ſtick to him: All theſe Deſigns <hi>Fauſta</hi> reveals to <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and withall, informs him, <hi>That the intended Marriage, was but to make him ſecure, that her Father might the ſooner deprive him of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and perhaps of his Life alſo.</hi> This intention of <hi>Maximinian</hi> ſoon appears, for he forthwith publickly aſſumes the Name and Authority of Emperour, at <hi>Arles,</hi> from whence retiring to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> he was there Beſieg'd by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:96414:25"/>and ſoon made his Priſoner, and afterward Executed upon himſelf the juſt vengeance of Perjury and Treaſon, for he ſtrangl'd himſelf with a Halter; ſuch a deſerv'd and ignominious end had this Tyrant, who defil'd the <hi>Western</hi> Empire with the Blood of ſo many <hi>Chriſtians. Conſtantine</hi> thus Victorious, proſecuted his Victories in <hi>Germany,</hi> where he built a Bridge over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and ſubdu'd ſeveral Rebellious Nations.</p>
            <p>He had, as is ſaid, ſeveral Noble <hi>Britains</hi> in his Army with him, amongſt which three Unckles of his Mother <hi>Helena</hi> are Nam'd, <hi>Johelin, Traer</hi> and <hi>Marius.</hi> At this time, although <hi>Constantine</hi> were not a <hi>Christian,</hi> yet he afforded the <hi>Christians</hi> the like Peace which they enjoy'd under his Father; Monaſteries were Repleniſh'd and Built, thoſe of <hi>Abingdon</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter</hi> being the principal; the firſt whereof was ſpeedily Finiſh'd, and Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the memory of St. <hi>Amphibalus;</hi> and for the ſpace of 200 years pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper'd, till the time of <hi>Cerdicus</hi> the <hi>Weſt Saxon,</hi> who then deſtroying the <hi>Monks,</hi> turn'd it into a Temple of Idolatry. As for that in <hi>Abingdon,</hi> if the Chronicle of that place may be Credited, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelf in his younger days had his Education there. To this Monaſtery belong'd 500. <hi>Monks,</hi> who got their living by their Labour abroad, but every <hi>Sunday</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to their Monaſtery to perform their Devotions, ſixty more were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly Reſident, attending in the Recital of <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Sacrifices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was now that Almighty God in revenge of the Innocent Blood of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhed by the Tyrant <hi>Galerius,</hi> viſited him with an inward and Incurable Rottenneſs, whereof he dy'd, having for a long time conſum'd him by piece-meal with great Stench and Torment; neither could he appeaſe the wrath of God, although, but too late, he acknowledg'd the Juſtice of God, and ſent out Edicts in favour of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Thus ended the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Perſecution firſt rais'd by <hi>Diocleſian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There yet remain'd four perſons who Supremely and Independently go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd their ſeveral Provinces; <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Britain, Maxentius</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Africk, Maximinus</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and <hi>Licinius</hi> in the <hi>Pannonia, Greece, Illyrium</hi> and <hi>Thrace;</hi> all which Provinces in a ſhort time became united under the Monarchy of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 112th. year of Chriſt was now come, Proſperous to the Church of God: Happy was it for <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that <hi>Maxentius</hi> refus'd agreement with <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſuch were the manifold Vices, Oppreſſions, Murders, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and great Enormities of <hi>Maxentius,</hi> that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was in a manner enforc'd, not only for his own ſafety, but the general good of Mankind to free the World of ſuch a Monſter, odious not only to <hi>Christians,</hi> but to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> alſo, to conclude a War againſt the Tyrant, though ſtronger then himſelf, <hi>Constantine</hi> therefore had recourſe to Divine aſſiſtance; but ſuch a multitude of Gods were Worſhip'd in the World, that he was uncertain, to which of them he ſhould Addreſs himſelf: After ſerious conſideration, calling to mind how former Emperours had been abus'd to their own ruine, by falſe Oracles, Incantations and Inhumane Sacrifices offer'd to their <hi>Heathen</hi> Gods, he reſolves to put his Confidence in that only true God, which his Mother <hi>Helena</hi> Worſhip'd all her Life, and his Father <hi>Conſtantius</hi> towards his end: To that God he offer'd Zealous and Devout Prayers, <hi>That he would diſcover to him, who he was, and how he would be Worſhip'd, and would protect him in his preſent condition of danger.</hi> His Devotion was not in vain, for by a ſtupendious Miracle, in the ſight of the whole Army, God declar'd his acceptance of his Supplicants Prayers, for he ſaw over the <hi>Sun,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:96414:26"/>then begining to decline, the Sign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> in Heaven, figur'd by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent light, together with theſe words inſcrib'd, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>By this be Victorious;</hi> Which Spectacle caus'd great admiration, both to himſelf and his Army. <hi>Artemius,</hi> one of the Spectators, afterwards relates this Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, and Vouches many of his then preſent Soldiers for Spectators, and further Witneſſes thereof, ſome writers add, <hi>That many Angels were ſeen with this Apparition, who encourag'd</hi> conſtantine, <hi>and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him Victory by that Sign; and that he himſelf ſaw an Arm'd Horſeman, who bore in his Hands the ſign of the</hi> Croſs <hi>as an Enſign.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Army were Encourag'd by this Coeleſtial Viſion, but the <hi>Pagans</hi> look'd upon it as a Fatal and Ominous Sign, until the ſucceeding Victory prov'd it otherwiſe: Nay at firſt the good Emperour himſelf, was in great doubt what this ſtrange Viſion ſhould Portend, until at night our Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to him in his Sleep, bearing the ſame Sign with him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Conſtantine, To cauſe a Draught or Copy thereof to be fram'd, and to be made uſe of by him, as a Guard and Protection in all his Battels.</hi> According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Conſtantine</hi> inſtructed his moſt cunning Workmen to make a Banner in imitation thereof, Adorn'd with Gold and Precious Stones, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually had carry'd before him in his Army: He caus'd likewiſe innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable repreſentations of the <hi>Croſs</hi> to be fix'd in ſeveral publick and Private places, eſpecially in ſeveral parts of his own Palace, where it was for the moſt part fram'd of Gold, Jewels and Precious Stones. No wonder then if the veneration of the <hi>Holy Croſs,</hi> every day more and more increas'd amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> a practice us'd from the moſt Primitive times, and now Authoriz'd by our Lord himſelf from Heaven, as it hath been ſure confirm'd by innumerable Miracles wrought in ſeveral Ages by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantine</hi> encourag'd by this Promiſe of Divine aſſiſtance, and Arm'd with this Glorious Sign of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> makes towards <hi>Italy,</hi> Conquers ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations, reduces ſeveral Cities, and overcomes all Reſiſtance; and having clear'd all the Provinces behind him, marches Couragiouſly to <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf; where the Tyrant for more than ſix years had exercis'd all manner of Wickedneſs. He had not Courage to Iſſue out of the City, or oppoſe <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Progreſs, ſtupify'd with his Luſts, and afrighted with Prodigies, and the Divination of his South-ſayers: But when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> approach'd the City, <hi>Maxentius</hi> was enforc'd to draw out his Army, conſiſting of 17000 Foot, and 1800. Horſe; theſe numerous Forces he rang'd beyond the <hi>Milvian Bridge,</hi> ſo that they were ſhut out of the City by the River. The Tyrant us'd this Stratagem alſo, he caus'd the Bridge to be ſo fram'd, that at his pleaſure he might diſſolve it: <hi>Conſtantine</hi> having rang'd his Army on the other ſide, himſelf with great Courage gave the on-ſet; by which he immediately broke his Enemies Ranks, ſo as little reſiſtance was made, except by the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Soldiers, who having Created <hi>Maxentius</hi> Emperour, expected no Pardon, and cover'd the ground with the dead Bodies: Thoſe who endeavour'd flight, found it unſucceſsful, being hindred by the ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Bridge; the ſlaughter was exceeding great, there being no other way to avoid the Sword, but plunging into the River, wherein great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes were ſwallow'd. The Tyrant himſelf caſting off the marks of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, adventur'd into <hi>Tyber,</hi> and being hurry'd down the Stream was drown'd; his Body being caſt upon the ſhore, the People found, and cut off his Head, which with great Joy and Triumph, they carry'd up and down the City faſtn'd to a Pole.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:96414:26"/>
            <p>It is affirm'd, that ſince <hi>Rome</hi> was built, never was a day Celebrated with greater or more univerſal Joy, than the day whereon <hi>Conſtantine</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd for this Victory: His Triumphant Chariot, was attended not with Conquer'd Princes or Generals but with the Nobility of <hi>Rome,</hi> freed from Dungeons and Chains; <hi>Rome</hi> did not indeed Inrich her ſelf with Spoils of Enemies, but ceas'd to be the Spoil of an Inhumane Tyrant. However this Pious Emperour, would have this common Joy and Applauſe, aſcrib'd not to himſelf, but to God only, by virtue of the <hi>Holy Croſs,</hi> to whom only he gave the Praiſe and Honour of this Victory: At his Triumphal entrance into the City, he caus'd the <hi>Croſs</hi> to be carried before his Army, that <hi>Rome</hi> might ſee by what Arms, ſhe had been freed from Slavery; he alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd the People and Senate to Proſtrate themſelves before that Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Sign, and to Adore the Name of Chriſt, who had Enobl'd the ſame.</p>
            <p>It is therefore a narrow conceit of ſome, who will not acknowledge that the <hi>Croſs</hi> was ever Honour'd or Venerated by this Emperour, or his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, when it is moſt manifeſt by undenyable Teſtimony; for it is well known, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> Dedicated a Church to the Honour of the <hi>Holy Croſs.</hi> This Honour of the <hi>Croſs Prudentius</hi> thus ſounds forth.</p>
            <q>Vex illum Crucis ſummus Dominator Adorat.</q>
            <p>And not only ſo, but the ſaid Emperour ſignifies his will that all the World ſhould alſo do ſo. This Prince alſo, further to Honour this Sign of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, cauſeth his Statue to be ſet up in <hi>Rome,</hi> holding a <hi>Croſs</hi> in the right Hand with this Inſcription. <hi>By this ſaving Sign, the Emblem of Fortitude, I deliver'd your City from the yoak of Tyranny; and having given perfect Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Senate and People of</hi> Rome, <hi>I reſtor'd them to their Antient Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Splendour.</hi> There was another Inſcription Engraven in Stone by the Decree of the Senate of like purport with the former, wherein the Victory is aſcrib'd, contrary to the <hi>Roman</hi> cuſtom, to one True God, and not to the many Gods there Ador'd.</p>
            <p>After this ſignal Victory, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſent for <hi>Licinius</hi> the Emperour to <hi>Millain,</hi> and there gave him to Wife his Siſter <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> and procur'd an Edict from him for free Liberty to profeſs the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion: what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to Churches, was reſtor'd unto them. Both <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Lacinius</hi> joyn in their requeſt to <hi>Maximinus</hi> the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Emperour, to grant the like freedom within his Dominions; to which requeſt <hi>Maximinus</hi> with much unwillingneſs yielded: <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> affirms, <hi>That about this time</hi> Conſtantine <hi>choſe into the Senate his three <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles before-mention'd, which might perhaps give occaſion to</hi> Julian <hi>the Apoſtate, afterwards to darken the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of this Glorious Emperour, as a perverter of the Antient</hi> Roman <hi>Laws, in being the firſt who Adorn'd Barbarous Strangers with Conſular Robes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year of Grace 314. <hi>Silveſter</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Melchiades</hi> in the Popedom. It was this <hi>Melchiades</hi> who ordain'd, that of the Oblations offer'd by the People in the Church, the Biſhop or Prieſt ſhould Conſecrate Loaves of Bread, cut into ſmall parcels, and kept in a pure Veſſel, that after the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of <hi>Maſs,</hi> ſuch as had not Communicated, ſhould partake of them on all <hi>Sundays</hi> and <hi>Feaſts.</hi> Theſe Morſels of Bread thus Bleſs'd, were called <hi>Eulogia,</hi> and intended to be Symbols of unity in Faith and Charity, and were made of common Bread. This year whilſt <hi>Conſtantine</hi> fought proſperouſly againſt the <hi>Germans,</hi> a certain King of the <hi>Geviſſi</hi> in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> part of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:96414:27"/>call'd <hi>Octavius,</hi> made an Inſurrection againſt the Pro-Conſul, whom <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had intruſted with the Government of the Country; againſt whom the Emperour ſent his Uncle <hi>Traer,</hi> who landing about <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> ſoon took it; <hi>Octavius</hi> having notice thereof, comes againſt <hi>Traer</hi> with ſtrong Forces, and put him to flight, but in a ſecond Battle in <hi>Westmorland, Octavius</hi> is totally vanquiſh'd, and put to flight into <hi>Albania</hi> to King <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> for Succour. The alteration of Government in <hi>Britain</hi> might well occaſion this Rebellion of <hi>Octavius,</hi> in regard the <hi>Britains</hi> were now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by a Vicar of the Prefect of <hi>Gaul,</hi> where <hi>Constantine</hi> made his uſual abode, and was diſquieted more by the Faction of <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> than any other Commotions, ſo as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was enforc'd to procure a General Aſſembly, or Synod at <hi>Arles,</hi> for compoſing the Sedition rais'd by the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts,</hi> to which Synod the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops were call'd, and the proceedings thereof are as follows.</p>
            <p>Although Perſecution was ſomewhat abated, yet the Enemies of <hi>Christians</hi> to give them ſtill diſturbance, endeavour'd to divide them into Factions. The firſt publick Infamous Scene, of which ſcandal was <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> the occaſion this. <hi>Caecilianus</hi> Arch-Deacon of the place, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended <hi>Lucilla</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> woman living in that City, for that before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Holy Sacrament, ſhe had with Veneration kiſs'd the Head of a certain perſon, eſteem'd by her a Martyr, but not acknowledg'd for ſuch by the Biſhop: The Woman being Wealthy and Powerful, ſtudied revenge againſt <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> who was newly choſen Biſhop; and requir'd reſtitution of certain Veſſels of Silver and Gold belonging to the Church, which in the late Perſecution, had by his Predeceſſor been recommended to the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of ſome Elders of that City. They to avoid reſtoring of theſe Veſſels, joyn'd themſelves to the Faction of <hi>Botrus</hi> and <hi>Celeſius,</hi> who had ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſought after the ſaid Biſhoprick, but were rejected: This repulſe incited them to queſtion the Election of <hi>Caecilianus; Lucilla</hi> betook her ſelf to this Faction, who withdrew themſelves from the Communion of their Biſhop, and by means whereof a moſt horrible <hi>Schiſm</hi> was rais'd in <hi>Africk,</hi> the ſlame whereof could not be extinguiſh'd in many Ages.</p>
            <p>Theſe Factious perſons invited to <hi>Carthage</hi> ſeveral <hi>African</hi> Biſhops, who were convicted to be Traditors, ſuch as for fear of Perſecution had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd up to <hi>Heathen</hi> Magiſtrates, the Books and Veſſels belonging to the Church, of which Biſhops the principal was <hi>Secundus</hi> Primate of <hi>Numidia;</hi> they were in all 17. and kept their Aſſemblies at <hi>Carthage</hi> ſeparate from <hi>Caecilianus;</hi> and preſum'd Sacrilegiouſly to ordain another Biſhop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> one <hi>Majorinus,</hi> who had been Lectorer formerly to <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> and was now a Domeſtick of <hi>Lucilla.</hi> Theſe Biſhops, though they were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves manifeſt Traditors, yet queſtion'd the Ordination of <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he receiv'd it from <hi>Felix,</hi> and others, whom they falſly accus'd of their own Crime. They further wrongfully charge <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> with denying neceſſary Proviſion to ſeveral Martyrs in Priſon. Notwithſtanding all which Calumnies, he was acknowledg'd Lawful Biſhop, by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all other Catholick Biſhops.</p>
            <p>Now though this <hi>Schiſm</hi> was chiefly forg'd by <hi>Botrus</hi> and <hi>Celeſius,</hi> with the ſaid Elders and <hi>Lucilla,</hi> and increas'd by <hi>Secundus</hi> and other Traditor Biſhops, yet it took its Name from <hi>Donatus</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Majorinus</hi> in the <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and not from that <hi>Donatus,</hi> who being Biſhop of <hi>Caſae nigrae,</hi> by the inſtigation of <hi>Lucilla</hi> withdrew himſelf from the Communion of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96414:27"/>
               <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> and was condemn'd by <hi>Pope Melchiades.</hi> This unhappy <hi>Schiſm</hi> gain'd ſuch ſtrength in a ſhort ſpace, that in three years, joyning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto other Traditor Biſhops, and drawing into their Communion moſt of the <hi>Numidians,</hi> they aſſembled a Councel of no fewer than 270. Biſhops, who continu'd together 75 days, and repeating their former Conſtitutions, made a Decree in favour of the Traditors. When <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Maxentius,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> obtain'd Letters from <hi>Anulinus</hi> Governour of <hi>Africk,</hi> to write Letters to the Emperour in <hi>Gaul,</hi> full of Calumnious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation againſt <hi>Caecilianus;</hi> and ſome of theſe <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> Biſhops made a Voyage to the Emperour, whom they requeſted, <hi>to appoint ſome Judges of their Cauſe;</hi> He gave them this Anſwer with indignation, <hi>You require a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Judgement from me, who my ſelf expect the Judgement of Chriſt.</hi> Yet at laſt, with extream importunity, they wreſted from him for their Judges <hi>Materinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Colonia Aggrippina, Rhetitius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auſtim,</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles:</hi> Howbeit, ſoon after conſidering the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop, he commanded both Parties to attend the ſaid Judges at <hi>Rome,</hi> that the difference might be debated and concluded before <hi>Melchiades,</hi> to whom the Emperour wrote, to the end that the Conteſtants might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Judgement from Him, and the other Judges; <hi>As you know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Holy Law of God requires a Synod;</hi> Therefore being Aſſembled at <hi>Rome,</hi> the reſult of it was, that <hi>Donatus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caſaenigrae</hi> was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and <hi>Caecilianus</hi> acquitted: From this Judgement they impudently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd to the Emperour, who cryed out, <hi>O the rabid impudence of theſe mens fury; they have preſum'd to interpoſe an Appeal, as the cuſtom is among</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens <hi>in Secular Cauſes:</hi> Yet after all this, the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> were ſo ſhameleſs, as to boaſt that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had given Judgement for them; and to deprave the Judgement of <hi>Pope Melchiades,</hi> they traduce him for a Traditor.</p>
            <p>Still they continue their Tumults in <hi>Africa,</hi> and principally direct their malice againſt <hi>Felix,</hi> who ordain'd <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> and whom they accus'd of being a Traditor; <hi>Conſtantine</hi> left the determination of this difference to <hi>Aelianus</hi> Pro-Conſul of <hi>Africa,</hi> who detecting many Lyes and Frauds of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> legally pronounc'd the Innocence of <hi>Felix:</hi> Yet once more they Appeal'd to the Emperour, to whoſe Court many of their Biſhops repair'd, complaining that many of their moſt weighty Allegations had not been taken into conſideration by <hi>Aelianus. Whereupon</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>not daring to become a Judge, of a Judgement given by the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>he refer'd the matter to a Synod of all the</hi> Weſtern <hi>Biſhops, appointed to meet at the City of</hi> Arles, <hi>whoſe Charges were defray'd by the Emperour's order:</hi> In this Councel 200. Biſhops met, who in the firſt place re-examin'd the Cauſe of <hi>Felix,</hi> and declar'd him guiltleſs of the Crime of Traditor: And this Cauſe being determin'd, they thought fit to frame ſeveral Canons touching Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, to be obſerv'd throughout the whole Church.</p>
            <p>Firſt they Ordain'd, <hi>That the Feaſt of</hi> Eaſter <hi>ſhould in all Churches be Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated upon the ſame day, in oppoſition to the</hi> Quarto decimani, <hi>who obſerv'd it according to the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>cuſtom, upon the</hi> 14th. <hi>day of the firſt Moon in</hi> March, <hi>which practice began to prevail more and more in the</hi> Eaſt: To this Canon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops then of this Councel ſubſcrib'd. Another Canon of this Councel is worthy conſideration, namely, <hi>That all ſuch ſhould be remov'd from the Order of the Clergy, who in time of Perſecution, had deliver'd up to the</hi> Pagans <hi>the Holy Scriptures, or the Lords Veſſels deputed for the Chriſtian Sacrifice,</hi> as by the 20th. Canon of this Councel appears, which commands,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96414:28"/>
               <hi>That a place to offer Sacrifice, ſhould be afforded to a Stranger Biſhop, with Veſsels for that purpoſe;</hi> And thereupon <hi>Reſtitutus</hi> a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhop, who ſubſcrib'd to that Councel, did there offer Sacrifice accordingly. Some pretend a Canon in this Councel, <hi>That</hi> Deacons <hi>in their Ordination, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting their reſolution to Marry, might lawfully do it.</hi> If any ſuch Canon be foyſted into late Copies, giving <hi>Deacons</hi> any ſuch priviledge; yet ſeeing <hi>Priests</hi> were not therein mention'd, it is ſtrongly imply'd, that they were forbidden Marriage.</p>
            <p>At the concluſion of this Synod, a Letter was written in the Name of the whole Aſſembly to <hi>Pope Silveſter, Deſiring his Care and Diligence in the Obſervation of their Decrees in all Churches:</hi> The <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subſcribers to this Councel were theſe that follow, <hi>Eborius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>York, Reſtitutus</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> famous in the year of Grace 350. the third <hi>Adelfus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Camolodunum,</hi> or <hi>Maldon.</hi> About this time a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſputation was held before the Emperour and his Mother <hi>Helena,</hi> between ſome <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Biſhops, whereof <hi>Pope Silveſter</hi> was chief, and twelve <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> principal Maſters amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> in which conflict the Holy <hi>Pope</hi> by Scriptures and Miracles, ſo confirm'd the Faith, that he obtain'd a Noble Victory; inſomuch as the <hi>Jews</hi> fell into a ſlat Rebellion againſt the Emperour; But being ſuppreſs'd, were carried up and down, with their Ears cut off, as ſtigmatiz'd Slaves, that all men might be Witneſſes of their Crime, and deterr'd from the like preſumption: Some impute the ſaid Diſputation to <hi>Helena,</hi> as if ſhe were a favourer of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> before her Sons Converſion, and ſo only by his Example, contrary to the Truth of all Authentick Story. It may indeed be true, that her Piety was much increas'd by the Apparition of the Holy Croſs to her Son: Howbeit, there is no doubt but ſhe was a ſincere <hi>Chriſtian</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whatever Aſperſions may be caſt upon her, by ill-willers.</p>
            <p>In the year 317. <hi>Licinius</hi> forgetful of his Covenant with <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a Perſecution againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and a War againſt <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who after two Battels obtain'd a compleat Victory, accompanied with the Death of <hi>Licinius.</hi> This ſucceſs, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelf, under God, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Sacred Enſign of the <hi>Croſs;</hi> whereof <hi>Licinius</hi> was ſo afraid, that he commanded his Soldiers, not ſo much as to look toward it; for it was obſerv'd, that whoever bore that Enſign, could never be Wounded, the Darts caſt by the Enemy ſtill remaining ſix'd to the Staff ſupporting the <hi>Croſs:</hi> And now <hi>Conſtantine</hi> betook himſelf to Enrich and Adorn the Church, and confer Immunities upon Church-men, he publiſh'd a Law that all Clerks and Clergy-men, ſhould be excus'd from all Civil Offices and Duties, that by the ill-will or malice of any they might not be withdrawn from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. <hi>Nay,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Sozomen) by this Emperour's Decree, if any Clergy-man were called into Judgement by Civil Magiſtrates, they might Appeal to the Judgement of Biſhops, whoſe Sentence was to be Ratified, as if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd by the Emperour himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws were ſevere againſt Celibacy, ſo as Unmarry'd perſons were incapable of Inheritances; <hi>Conſtantine</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how prejudicial this was to <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, wherein many profeſs'd Virginity and Single lives, preferring the Love of <hi>Chriſtian Philoſophy</hi> and Perfection, before the Senſual Pleaſures of Matrimony, and Conſecrating themſelves both Soul and Body to the Service of God, in a Poor and Chaſte Life; for that reaſon, utterly aboliſh'd thoſe Antient Laws, ſhewing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96414:28"/>great Honour and Admiration to the Convents of Conſecrated Virgins. And if we will believe <hi>Sozomen, He ſo far priviledg'd all perſons Male or Female, who Conſecrated themſelves to Virginity, that though they were under Age, yet they ſhould have Power to diſpoſe of their Eſtates by Will, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the cuſtom of the</hi> Romans. He further alſo ordain'd, <hi>That a meaſure of Wheat ſhould yearly be given to Widows, and thoſe who obſerv'd a Virgin Life,</hi> (two thirds whereof <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate not long after took from them) <hi>He commanded publick reſt on the</hi> Lords day, <hi>and preſcrib'd a form of Prayer on that day for all perſons, eſpecially his Souldiers:</hi> Part whereof was in theſe words, <hi>We acknowledge thee, the only God, we prefeſs thee our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign King; we invoke thee our Helper, by thee we obtain Victories, and vanquiſh our Enemies; we acknowledge that from Thee we have obtain'd preſent Felicity, and hope to obtain future: We beſcech thee many years to preſerve ſafe and victorious</hi> Conſtantine <hi>our Emperour, with his Pious Children.</hi> He likewiſe in memory of our Saviours <hi>Croſs</hi> and Paſſion, ordain'd, <hi>That upon</hi> Fridays, <hi>ſome time ſhould be ſpent in Prayers to God.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>He not only Enrich'd the Church by his own Bounty, but by a Law open'd the Purſes of others to Endow it, by giving Licenſe to all perſons to bequeath what they thought ſit to the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By one Action indeed he ſtain'd the Purity of his Faith, for being at <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> and having notice, that his Palace at <hi>Rome</hi> was ſtruck with Lightning, an Ominous Sign to the <hi>Pagan Romans,</hi> and by their Antient Laws to be averted by many Superſtitious Luſtrations; he condeſcended to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the Magiſtrates to Conſult the <hi>Sooth-ſayers,</hi> what the meaning of it might be; but commanded them to abſtain from Domeſtical Sacrifices. This unlawful complyance of the Emperour, turn'd to the prejudice of the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> for by colour thereof, (at the inſtigation of the <hi>Sooth-ſayers)</hi> the <hi>Heathen</hi> Magiſtrates would compell the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to joyn in the publick Expiatory Sacrifices, ſo as many choſe rather to leave the City; and amongſt the reſt, the Holy <hi>Pope Silveſter. Conſtantine</hi> inform'd hereof, publiſhes an Edict, <hi>That if any ſhould go about to compel any</hi> Chriſtian <hi>to Celebrate</hi> Heatheniſh <hi>Luſtrations, he ſhould, (if a mean perſon,) be publickly beaten with Clubs; if otherwiſe, he ſhould be grievouſly Fin'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 324. after our Saviours Incarnation, according to the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Western</hi> Church, confirm'd by many Proofs; <hi>Conſtantine</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Baptiſm at <hi>Rome</hi> by the Hands of <hi>Pope Silvester;</hi> upon this occaſion, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had raſhly put to death <hi>Licinius</hi> his Siſters Son, falſly accus'd of a deſign to Rebel; and <hi>Criſpus</hi> his own Son, adorn'd with many Virtues, and famous for many Victories, yet accus'd by <hi>Fauſta</hi> his Mother-in-Law, to have attemptod her Chaſtity; which accuſation appearing after to be falſe, and invented by <hi>Fauſta</hi> maliciouſly, becauſe the young man would not yield to her Luſt; ſhe was by <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s order ſtifled in a Hot Bath. After which Crimes and Calamities, as appears by the ſecond General Councel of <hi>Nice:</hi> Almighty God ſtruck <hi>Conſtantine</hi> with a <hi>Leproſie:</hi> anxious to find a remedy; the <hi>Soothſayers</hi> told him, <hi>The only way to be reſtor'd, was by a Bath of Infants Blood:</hi> This deteſtable Medicine being abhorr'd by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> God was pleas'd to inſtruct him by a Viſion of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his ſleep, <hi>That it would be a certain remedy for him to receive Baptiſm at the hands of the</hi> Pope; Which he did accordingly with great Solemnity: In the place where he was Baptiz'd, he Erected a Magnificent Chappel; wherein was a Font of <hi>Porphyrie</hi> cover'd with Silver, and over it hung a Phiale of Pure Gold, wherein yearly 200 <hi>l.</hi> of <hi>Balſom</hi> was Burn'd; on the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96414:29"/>brink of the Font, was plac'd a Lamb of pure Gold, weighing 30 <hi>l.</hi> and pouring forth water into the Font: At the right ſide of the Lamb ſtood the Statue of our Saviour, all of pure Silver, weighing 170 <hi>l.</hi> On the left ſide was plac'd St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> holding a Scroul, whereon was written, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, Behold him who takes away the ſins of the World,</hi> &amp;c. The Emperour according to the Churches cuſtom, being for ſeven days, cloath'd in White, Conſecrated each of the ſaid days with ſome Signal act of Piety. On the firſt day he publiſh'd a Law, <hi>That Chriſt is the true Lord, who cleans'd him from his</hi> Leproſie, <hi>and whom he commanded to be Ador'd through the whole Empire,</hi> On the ſecond day he Decreed, <hi>Severe Puniſhments on thoſe who by Word or Deed ſhould Diſhonour him.</hi> On the third day he Decreed <hi>Like Penalties againſt thoſe who ſhould Perſecute or Moleſt any Chriſtians.</hi> On the fourth day, <hi>He confer'd on the</hi> Roman <hi>Churches Imperial Priviledges.</hi> On the fifth day, <hi>He granted Immunities to all other Churches.</hi> On the ſixth and ſeventh, <hi>he added many other Giſts to Eccleſiaſtical Perſons.</hi> And the day after he appear'd in publick, perfectly cleans'd from his Sins and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie,</hi> and coming to the Confeſſion of St. <hi>Peter, He took his Diadem from his Head, and putting off his Impertal Robes, with a Spade open'd the Earth for a Foundation of a new Church; and in Honour of the</hi> 12 <hi>Apoſtles, carry'd on his Shoulders</hi> 12 <hi>Baskets of Earth; and with great joy receiving the Biſhop into his Chariot, he return'd to his Palace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all this, he extended his Munificence to Gods Church all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire over; and ſent Letters to the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Biſhops, encouraging them to Build Churches, ſupplying them out of his publick Treaſure; which Churches he caus'd to be Conſecrated to the Honour of the Apoſtles and Martyrs, whoſe ſolemn Feaſts he commanded to be obſerv'd even by the <hi>Pagans</hi> with Honour and Veneration.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> they repair'd thither with great Zeal, and as Supplicants there, demanded the interceſſion of thoſe Martyrs; a practice then us'd, not only by the meaner ſort, but by perſons of the higheſt rank alſo: As St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> witneſſes, <hi>He who wears the Imperial Robe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>comes hither, he embraces the Sepulchers of the Martyrs, and laying aſide all haughtineſs and pride, ſtands before them in the Posture of a Supplicant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching them to intercede on his behalf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſo publick and zealous Profeſſion of a new Religion, render'd <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> diſpleaſing to ſome of the Senate, who could not with Patience endure the decay of their Antient Superſtition: For this cauſe he grew weary of <hi>Rome,</hi> and made a Progreſs into the <hi>Eastern</hi> Provinces; where he eſtabliſh'd a new ſeat of the Empire at <hi>Bizantium,</hi> after from his Name call'd <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and this he did the rather to compoſe the Tumults rais'd by the Blaſphemous Hereſie of <hi>Arius,</hi> who deny'd the Divinity of the Son of God; affirming, <hi>That time was, when he was not; though he was firſt of all Creatures:</hi> In which <hi>Hereſie,</hi> not a few Biſhops joyn'd with him to the great diſturbance and ſcandal of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church; <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> firſt admoniſh'd, then Excommunicated <hi>Arius.

            <p>It is obſervable; with what Meekneſs, Charity and Reſpectfulneſs the Pious Emperour behav'd himſelf towards the Biſhops; how he refus'd to judge of their Recriminations, how he fortify'd the Determinations of the Synod by his Authority, commanding ſubmiſſion thereunto; and how he baniſh'd the <hi>Arch-Heretick Arius.</hi> In this Councel was further Order made, <hi>For the univerſal Obſervation of</hi> Eaſter, <hi>upon the first</hi> Sunday <hi>following the</hi> 14th. <hi>day of the firſt Moon after the</hi> Vernal Equinox; <hi>for the better finding out of which, it was recommended to the care of the Patriarch of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>every year to give notice to the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>upon what day</hi> Eaſter <hi>was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, and this was to be communicated unto all remoter Churches; and during</hi> Maſs <hi>on the</hi> Epiphany, <hi>a Deacon with a loud voice declar'd the following</hi> Eaſter, <hi>whereby</hi> Lent, <hi>and all other moveable Feaſts, were regulated:</hi> And accordingly the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches alſo were guided, until recourſe from <hi>Rome</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by Domeſtick Broils, and the invaſion of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> and when by ſuch interruption the <hi>Britains</hi> varied from the <hi>Western</hi> Churches, they kept not <hi>Eaſter</hi> as the <hi>quarto decimani,</hi> preciſely upon the 14th. day of the <hi>Moon,</hi> after the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> mode; But if that 14th. day hapen'd upon a <hi>Sunday,</hi> they did not defer the Obſervation until the <hi>Sunday</hi> following, as other <hi>Catholick Chriſtian</hi> Churches us'd to do.</p>
            <p>Soon after this Councel of <hi>Nice, Helena</hi> the Mother of <hi>Constantine</hi> being near 80. years old, had the Courage to undertake a Pilgrimage to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to viſit the Holy places ſanctify'd by our Lords Actions and Sufferings, and to Adore his Footſteps: to which tedious Journey ſhe is ſaid to be incited by Divine Admonition: The Sepulchre of our Lord ſhe moſt ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd to ſee, which the flagitious Impiety of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> had endeavour'd to hide from the World, ſo that it coſt incredible Labour to remove that vaſt heap of Earth, wherewith it had been cover'd; on the top whereof a Temple to <hi>Venus</hi> was Erected: But the place being cleans'd, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> caus'd a moſt Magnificent Temple to be Erected upon it: Beſides which, his Mother began the building of two other Sumptuous Churches, one at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> where our Lord was born, another on Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> where he aſcended into Heaven, both which, after her Death, were finiſh'd by her Son.</p>
            <p>In the Mount was yet extant the Impreſſion of our Lords Feet, which this Devout Empreſs Honour'd with due Veneration: The Prophet <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> long before Propheſied, ſaying, <hi>And in that day his feet ſhall ſtand upon the Mount</hi> Olivet <hi>over-againſt</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to the</hi> Eaſt: And St. <hi>Jerom</hi> teſtifies, <hi>That the ſame footſteps of our Lord imprinted on the ground, were ſhewn in his time, ſo as though the Earth were continually taken away by the Devotion of Chriſtians, yet theſe Holy footſteps did receive and retain their former ſtate. Sulpitius Severus</hi> relates a ſtrange ſtory, namely, <hi>That the place where our Lords feet at his Aſcention ſtood, could not be continu'd to the reſt of the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about it, for whenſoever Marble was laid on it, the Earth refus'd to receive it, caſting the Stones oft times upwards in the Faces of thoſe which apply'd them; and the footſteps of our Lord there ſeen, are a laſting Monument, that the Duſt there had been trod on by our Saviour.</hi> To this <hi>Beda</hi> adds, <hi>That whereas the Temple built over this place, conſiſted of three Stories, the uppermoſt whereof were Vaulted with Arches; that which was the loweſt and moſt inward, could by no Art or Labour be clos'd with a Vault.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Holy Empreſs was now in earneſt queſt of the Holy Croſs on which our Lord perfected the Redemption of Mankind, by the Apparition of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96414:30"/>which her Son had been lately drawn to Faith and Baptiſm: A Rumour there was, that it was ſtill extant, and hid up in ſome of thoſe Holy places, but where to find it was the difficulty; ſeveral places thereabout were dig'd, but all in vain; at laſt the Religious Lady was by a Coeleſtial Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition inform'd where it lay. Whereupon cauſing all the Rubbiſh to be remov'd, ſhe found under ground three Croſſes in a confus'd order, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by her joy was diminiſh'd, by the uncertainty which was the true one; there was alſo found with them the Title which had been written by <hi>Pilate</hi> in <hi>Greek, Latin</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters; but being ſeparated, gave no token to diſcern which was our Lords <hi>Croſs:</hi> In this doubtfulneſs, the only remedy was by Prayer to beg a Divine Teſtimony: At the ſame time, there was in the City a Woman of quality, who lay Sick of a Grievous Diſeaſe, ready to Expire; <hi>Macarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſeeing the Empreſs ſo ſollicitous to diſcover the true <hi>Croſs,</hi> commanded that all-three ſhould be brought, not doubting but that God would diſcover the true one; and being enter'd with the Empreſs into the Sick Womans Chamber, Pray'd, <hi>That God would be pleas'd to ſhew unto them, which of thoſe three</hi> Croſſes <hi>was imploy'd to gloriſie our Lord, and which for the puniſhments of the Malefactors, and that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery might be made by the reſtoring of the Woman half dead, upon the touches of the True</hi> Croſs. The firſt and ſecond were apply'd without any avail or effect; but as ſoon as the third was apply'd unto her, ſhe open'd her Eyes, and roſe up in perfect Health, and went about her Houſe with great ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, Praiſing and Glorifying the Power of God.</p>
            <p>And thus was the Empreſs ſatisfy'd in her longing deſire, by the Atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Eccleſiaſtical Writers, ſo as in memory of this ſaving ſign, ſhe Dedicated a peculiar Church; and for the Croſs it ſelf thus found, ſhe ſent part of it to the Emperour, to be Honourably beſtow'd in his Palace; the remainder ſhe enclos'd in a Box of Silver, and gave it to the Biſhop of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> to be reſerv'd as a Monument of our Salvation; and for many years after, upon the day of our Lords Reſurrection, it was produc'd with Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration by the Biſhop, and expos'd alſo to the People to be by them likewiſe Venerated. That part which was ſent to <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> he enclos'd in a Statue of his own, which was plac'd on a mighty Pillar of <hi>Porphyry</hi> in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and was by him eſteem'd as a mighty Bulwark of his Empire: The Nails which pierc'd our Saviours Sacred fleſh, were artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enclos'd in the Emperour's Helmet, as a Guard for his Head. One of them indeed in a great Tempeſt the Empreſs threw into the <hi>Adriatick Sea,</hi> and by that means, as is preſum'd, ſav'd her ſelf and Company from Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Helena</hi> being a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Princeſs, drawing near the end of her Life, increas'd in her Zeal and Piety; her Humility and Devout reſpect to Holy Virgins Conſecrated to the Service of God, appear'd by this example, <hi>That ſhe invited ſome of them to Dinner, and thought it not enough that her Maids ſhould attend upon them, but girding her ſelf after the manner of a waiting Maid, ſet Meat upon the Table, gave them Drink, and pour'd Water on their Hands:</hi> Thus, though an Empreſs, ſhe eſteem'd her ſelf no better than a a Servant and Handmaid of Chriſt and his Virgins: In all her Progreſs through the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Provinces, ſhe largely expreſs'd her wonderful Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, giving innumerable Gifts, not only to particular Perſons, but to whole Cities; ſhe largely reliev'd the Poor, ſuch as were condemn'd to work in Mines, or perpetual Impriſonment, ſhe ſet at liberty, the Oppreſs'd ſhe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96414:30"/>deliver'd from fraud and injury, and the Baniſh'd ſhe reſtor'd to their own Country.</p>
            <p>In her return out of <hi>Palestine</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> ſhe paſs'd by <hi>Drepanum</hi> in <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynia,</hi> where repos'd the Body of the Glorious Martyr <hi>Lucianus;</hi> as ſoon as ſhe ſaw his Relicks neglected, without any mark of Honour or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſhe caus'd a Sumptuous Church to be Built over them, and enlarg'd the place into a City with Walls and Bulwarks, call'd by her Son after her Name <hi>Helenopolis.</hi> Moreover, this Holy Empreſs in her Progreſs through the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> having been inform'd where the Bodies of the three Wiſe men who came to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to Adore our new-born Saviour, repos'd, brought them with her to her Son <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who Reverently laid them in the chief Church of his new City, from whence they were tranſlated to <hi>Milan,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Colen,</hi> where they now are Celebrated with great Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In ſuch Pious Works did this Holy Empreſs conclude her Worldly Pilgrimage.</p>
            <p>It is moſt probable ſhe Deceas'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> Aged above 80 years, and was there Honourably Interr'd; her occaſion of returning thither, was after the laudable cuſtom of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in thoſe days to viſit the Sepulchres of the two chief Apoſtles: She brought with her to <hi>Rome</hi> a part of the Holy <hi>Croſs,</hi> which, with great Veneration ſhe plac'd in a Church there Built at her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt by her Son, call'd by the Title of the <hi>Holy Croſs.</hi> It is reported, <hi>She ſpent her laſt days in great Devotion, and approaching to her Death, after her receiving the Sacraments of the Church, ſhe was comforted with a Viſion of our Lord Jeſus, encompaſs'd with a multitude of Angels, and holding his</hi> Croſs, <hi>ſhining with inexpreſſible Brightneſs. Euſebius</hi> teſtiſies, <hi>That her Son</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine <hi>with all humble reſpect attended her in her Sickneſs, and was preſent at her Death; having receiv'd many Devout Exhortations, and the Benediction of a Parent from her:</hi> Such was the Emperour's Piety and Reſpect to his Mother, that ſhe is ſaid, <hi>To have reign'd as Empreſs with him, to be ſtil'd</hi> Auguſta, <hi>to be transfer'd into the</hi> Flavian <hi>Family; ſo that many Golden Coins were made and ſtamp'd with her Image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After her Death, her Son <hi>Conſtantine</hi> built unto her Honour a Magnificent Sepulchre or <hi>Mauſoleum,</hi> where in a Tomb of <hi>Porphyry</hi> he laid her Bleſſed Body, ſcituate in the High-way, call'd <hi>Lavicana,</hi> between two <hi>Lawrel-Trees,</hi> her Body afterwards, if we will believe the <hi>Gallican Martyrology,</hi> was remov'd into a Monaſtery in <hi>France,</hi> and there continu'd Illuſtrious by many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. In the Church of the <hi>Holy Croſs</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> Antiently call'd, <hi>The Church of St.</hi> Helena; an Illuſtrious Monument was Erected in memory of her, and the like is to be ſeen in <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Iſland wherein this Noble Empreſs was born, hath not been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to her Memory. The Monuments of her and all others rais'd by the <hi>Britains,</hi> have been conſum'd by Age; but even the <hi>Saxons,</hi> when once Converted to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> left many Monuments and Expreſſes of their Devout reſpect to this <hi>Britiſh</hi> Lady, by Conſecrating Churches in memory of her, witneſs <hi>Hellenſtone</hi> in <hi>Barkſhire,</hi> and ſeveral Churches Dedicated in this Saints Name in <hi>London,</hi> and many other places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantine</hi> continues his Zeal againſt <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatry, and made ſevere Laws againſt <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Sacrifices, overthrowing the moſt Celebrated of the Idol-Temples; neither was he wanting to eſtabliſh the Churches Peace, by publiſhing ſevere Edicts againſt all ſorts of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and their Aſſemblies, mingled with ſuch perſwaſive Exhortations, that many of them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96414:31"/>their Errours, return'd to the Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> Yet this Holy Emperour being ſeduc'd by the Craft of <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> the Pillar of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Faction, he began to be diſpleas'd with St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> His Siſter <hi>Conſtantia</hi> check'd him at her Death with his Severity to the <hi>Arrians,</hi> whom ſhe accounted Innocent perſons; upon this the Emperour wrote a threatning Letter to <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> enjoyning him to receive <hi>Arrius;</hi> but being after inform'd, that this <hi>Arrius</hi> ſtill perſiſted in his <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and without any Repentance oppos'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Nice,</hi> the good Emperour no longer inſiſted upon his Reception; and not only ſtuck to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> againſt the <hi>Miletians,</hi> but turn'd his Anger againſt the ſaid <hi>Euſebius,</hi> his chiefeſt Enemy, whom he baniſh'd with other Confederate Biſhops from their Sees; though ſoon after, upon the Inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his new City <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as objects of his Clemency, he thought fit to reſtore them.</p>
            <p>This City is ſaid to be Conſecrated to our Lord and his Immaculate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the offering of the unbloody Sacrifice and Prayers; and then a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue was erected for <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in a publick place upon a Pillar of <hi>Porphyry,</hi> holding in his right Hand a Golden Apple, on which was placed the <hi>Holy Croſs,</hi> with this Inſcription, <hi>To thee, O Chriſt, our Lord, I commend this City. Euſebius</hi> writes, <hi>That</hi> Conſtantine <hi>adorn'd his new City, eſpecially with Magniſicent Churches, Conſecrated to Holy Martyrs, the chief whereof were St.</hi> Moſcus, <hi>St.</hi> Agathonicus, <hi>St.</hi> Mennas <hi>and St.</hi> Acatius. One Church he built in a place there formerly Dedicated to <hi>Veſta,</hi> and call'd it St. <hi>Michael,</hi> from an Apparition of that Holy Arch-Angel: In which, by virtue of the <hi>Holy Croſs</hi> there erected, many Miracles are ſaid to have been wrought; one of which I cannot omit, <hi>viz. That a Soldier of the Emperour's Guards,</hi> Probianus <hi>by Name, afflicted with grievous Torments in his feet, not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd eaſe in that place, but was alſo honour'd with a wonderful and Divine Viſion. He was converted to Chriſtianity, and thoroughly ſatisfied with all points of that Religion; yet he could never be perſwaded that the</hi> Holy Croſs <hi>could be any wiſe inſtrumental to the Salvation of mankind: Being thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, the Image of the</hi> Croſs <hi>was preſented to him in a Viſion, as it was uſually ſet on the Altar of that Church; and in the ſame Viſion it was declar'd to him manifeſtly, that what thing ſoever had been perform'd either by Angels or Holy men, for the publick or private profit of men, ſince Chriſt was Crucified, were not rightly perform'd, but by Virtue of the</hi> Saving Croſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was not wanting richly to Endow the Churches he had built, he caus'd Copies of the Holy Scriptures to be Curiouſly writ in Parchments, richly adorn'd, which he diſpers'd and plac'd in his ſaid Churches; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages the Profeſſors of all Arts and Sciences, ſo as Learning flouriſh'd in his City; he endeavour'd to make it equal with old <hi>Rome,</hi> by placing Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators there with the ſame Honour and Authority, and many of them Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of this Serene Calm, a ſharp ſtorm ſell upon the good <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> principal Defender of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith; for the reſtleſs malice of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> prick'd them on to accuſe him falſly, <hi>Of breaking a Chalice, of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of Enchantments with his dead Hand, of Adultery by Violence,</hi> &amp;c. His Cauſe was examin'd in a Synod of Biſhops aſſembled at <hi>Tyre,</hi> by whom, to the great aſtoniſhment of <hi>Conſlantine,</hi> the good <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> though in all particulars his Innocency was evidently declar'd, was yet unjuſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and by the importunity of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Emperour's Son, infected
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96414:31"/>with that Poiſonous <hi>Arrian Hereſie,</hi> baniſh'd into the <hi>West,</hi> or rather advisd to withdraw himſelf, to avoid the impetuous clamour of the <hi>Arrians</hi> againſt him: For he retir'd to <hi>Triers</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where by the Emperour's order, he wanted nothing. Now that this was not conſented unto by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> as in any wiſe wavering in the Faith, may appear by this following Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Conſtantine <hi>deſiring to be ſatisfi'd what the Opinion of</hi> Arrius <hi>truly was, ask'd him, whether he did approve the Decrees of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Councel: He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently with a chearful countenance, anſwered, That he approv'd them: The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour not ſatisfied with this Affirmation, urg'd him to confirm it by an Oath; to which likewiſe he comply'd; But all this was impious Craft and ſubtilty; for whilſt he made this Profeſſion and Oath, he had in his boſom a Paper containing his</hi> Hereſie, <hi>and ſwore from his Heart he believ'd what he had written, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſtill to that Paper;</hi> Conſtantine <hi>never the leſs warn'd him, that if his Faith were true and Orthodox, he had ſworn well; but if otherwiſe, God</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>may condemn thee for thy Perjury. However</hi> Conſtantine <hi>being deluded with this Equivocation, ſent to the Piſhop of</hi> Alexandria <hi>to receive the Hypocrite into Communion:</hi> But we ſhall preſently ſee how God diſcover'd miraculouſly the Impiouſneſs of <hi>Arrius,</hi> and true Faith of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For</hi> Alexander <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>not willing to admit the Arch-Heretick, but ſollicitous for the True Faith, more than for his Biſhoprick, which ſome threat ned to deprive him of; lay proſtrate ſeveral days and nights before his Altar, and pray'd to God, that if the Opinion of</hi> Arrius <hi>were true, he might die before the day of Diſputation came; But in caſe the Faith which he profeſs'd were true, then that</hi> Arrius, <hi>the Author of all thoſe Calamities, might ſuffer juſt puniſhment for his Impiety: Which Prayer it ſeems was ſoon heard; for</hi> Arrius <hi>in his way to the Church, uſing many vain and boaſting Bablings, was on a ſuddain ſorc'd to retire to a common Privy to eaſe himſelf; where, as is written of</hi> Judas, <hi>he fell on his Face to the ground and burſt aſunder in the middle, and was in that manner depriv'd both of Life and Communion: This ſtruck the</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebian <hi>Faction with wonderful Terrour and conſternation, the Fame whereof ſoon ſpread it ſelf over the whole World, and confirm'd the Emperour's Faith, and the</hi> Nicene <hi>Decrees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This year dy'd the Holy Pope <hi>Marcus,</hi> Succeſſor of <hi>Silveſter,</hi> and in his ſtead <hi>Julius</hi> ſucceeded in the laſt year of our Renowned Emperour, one of whoſe laſt Acts of Devotion, was the building of a moſt Magnificent Temple at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in Honour of all the Apoſtles, that he might Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize their memory among all Nations. In this Temple, he placed twelve Honorary Repoſitories, which ſhould be as ſo many Pillars, in memory of the twelve Apoſtles, and caus'd his own Tomb to be plac'd in the midſt of them, enclos'd on each ſide with ſix of them, having an opinion, <hi>That their memory would procure much profit to his Soul, by being ſo made partaker of their Prayers, which would there be offer'd in Honour of the Apoſtles.</hi> As many other <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> Kings, in erecting Churches and Monaſterres have ſince done, for the Redemption of their Souls; and ſo expreſs'd themſelves in ſeveral Charters of their Foundation.</p>
            <p>This Emperour it ſeems ſo Happily enjoy'd his faculties and ſtrength of Reaſon, in ſuch perfection, that till the extremity of his Age, he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd to write Orations, and to Miniſter Advice to his Friends, well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a good Chriſtian. He alſo publiſh'd good Laws, expedient for Humane Society; and not long before his Death, he recited a Funeral Oration in the uſual place, wherein he Diſcourſed, <hi>Of the Immortality of Souls,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96414:32"/>of the Rewards of Pious men, and the Miſeries of ſuch who liv'd ungodly lives.</hi> This he pronounc'd with ſuch Gravity and Conſtancy, that one of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtique Servants (a <hi>Pagan</hi>) and pretender to Wiſdom, being ask'd what he thought of the Emperour's Oration, Anſwered, though with ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs, <hi>That the things ſpoken ſeemed to be true, eſpecially commending that part of the Oration which decry'd a multitude of Gods.</hi> It is ſaid, that a <hi>Comet</hi> of an unuſual bigneſs, appear'd in the Heavens, as portending his death; for he ſoon after fell into ſome Diſtemper, which enforc'd him to uſe Hot Baths; and being remov'd to his Mothers City <hi>Helenopolis</hi> in <hi>Bythinia,</hi> he continu'd ſome conſiderable time, in the Church Conſecrated to the Holy Martyr St. <hi>Lucianus,</hi> there offering his Prayers and publick Vows to God; and there conſidering his laſt day, he fell humbly upon his Knees in this Church, confeſſing his ſins, and craving pardon for them; and then it was that he firſt became worthy to receive <hi>Abſolution</hi> by <hi>impoſition of Hands</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> in imitation of the <hi>Saving Laver of Baptiſm:</hi> After theſe and ſuch like Holy Myſteries were perform'd, he was cloath'd with Kingly Robes, ſhining bright as the Light, and then laid in a Bed of a moſt pure Whiteneſs; his Imperial Purple he rejected, and never made uſe of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: Then with a clear diſtinct voice he Pray'd, and gave Thanks to God, declaring, <hi>He was now aſſur'd of Happineſs and Immortality, being made partaker of Divine Light.</hi> With great deteſtation he bewail'd the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſtate of <hi>Pagans,</hi> in that they were depriv'd of all Divine Bleſſings. To his great Officers who ſtood about him, and deplor'd their unhappineſs in the loſs of ſuch an Emperour, wiſhing him a long Life; he anſwer'd, <hi>That he had now attain'd true Life indeed, and he himſelf underſtood his own Happineſs, and therefore he long'd for his departure to God.</hi> And having made his Will, and given Honourable Penſions to the Inhabitants of his new City, and left his Empire as a Patrimony to his Children; during the Solemnity of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> he departed this Life in Glory and Renown.</p>
            <p>The univerſal Mourning and Sorrow of his People, and the Solemnities of his Funeral are ſet forth at large by many Authors: Great multitudes of the People, with the Prieſts, ceas'd not to pour forth their Prayers to God with Tears and Groaning for the Soul of their departed Emperour; his memory was alſo ſo precious amongſt the <hi>Britains,</hi> that they built Temples in Honour of him, one whereof ſtill remains of his Name in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> which was erected after they were driven by the <hi>Saxons</hi> into thoſe quarters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantine</hi> at his death, divided the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire amongſt his three Sons, ſo that his Eldeſt Son <hi>Conſtantine</hi> enjoy'd <hi>Gaul, Spain, Britain,</hi> and all the Conquer'd Countries on this ſide the <hi>Alpes. Conſtantius</hi> his ſecond Son, only preſent at his Fathers Death, poſſeſs'd himſelf of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Regions and <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And the youngeſt Son <hi>Conſtans</hi> had the Government of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Africk.</hi>

            <p>Now as touching the ſecond <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> within whoſe Juriſdiction our Country is compriz'd: His Reign was ſhort, not laſting full four years; ſure it is He and his Brother <hi>Conſtans</hi> ſtuck cloſe to the <hi>Catholick Faith</hi> Eſtabliſh'd in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel, ſo as all the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches were by their means ſecur'd from the infection of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> which miſcrably defac'd the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> parts, in regard <hi>Conſtantius</hi> there ſuffer'd himſelf to be perverted by the <hi>Arrian Hereticks: Conſtantine</hi> the younger, in proof of his Orthodoxy, and in performance of his Fathers Will, reſtor'd <hi>Athanaſius</hi> from his baniſhment at <hi>Triers,</hi> where he had continu'd above two years, to his Church at <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria;</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:96414:32"/>his baniſhment was the eaſier to him, in regard he was ſent thither by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Father in order to his ſafety, and entertain'd there with all Honour and Liberality by <hi>Constantine</hi> the Son, whoſe conſtant reſidence was in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and who govern'd <hi>Britain</hi> by a Deputy, never coming thither himſelf.</p>
            <p>In the 4th. year of his Reign, he paſs'd over into <hi>Italy,</hi> upon what deſign is uncertain; However he was ſoon there Traytorouſly ſlain by his Brothers Soldiers, if not by his Order. By the Death of this <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the whole <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire became the Dominion of <hi>Conſtans,</hi> who placed <hi>Vetranio</hi> as his Lieutenant in <hi>Britain,</hi> where after a few years, he uſurp'd the Title of Emperour. About this time there flouriſh'd in <hi>Britain</hi> a Holy Biſhop of great fame, call'd St. <hi>Gudwall,</hi> who was born of Noble Parents, and largely communicated to others thoſe Treaſures of Heavenly Wiſdom, which he had been gathering from his youth; his Inſtructions Enlightn'd many, ſo as they were enabled to enflame others with Divine Love, the Odour of his Holy Converſation declaring in him the operations of Heavenly Grace, was pleaſant to all both Clergy and Laity: The Patrimony he receiv'd from his Parents, was very ample; yet deſpiſing worldly Riches, he gave it all to the Church: And perceiving his Paſtoral Office, engag'd him in Worldly Cares and Solicitudes, and willing to disburden himſelf thereof; he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends his Church to a worthy Succeſſor, and retires himſelf into a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery within his own Dioceſs, where he led a perfect Monaſtical, or rather Angelical Life: His Monaſtery was placed near the Sea, in a Bay where-of the Holy man obſerving a certain vaſt Rock, or Promontory ſhooting forth, retir'd thither, that he might attend on God without interruption; into which place he gather'd to him about the number of 180. Diſciples. It is reported, <hi>That the place being too ſtrait for ſo many, the Bleſſed man having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to God, in whoſe Power and Goodneſs he plac'd his confidence, when the Sea at low ebb had left the ſhoar for a great ſpace, with a Rod which he had in his Hands, made impreſſions in ſeveral places of the Sands, and commanded the waters in the Name of Chriſt, not to paſs thoſe bounds, upon which the Sea was obſerv'd to reſtrain its own violence and ſwelling, inſomuch, as to this day, it hath never preſum'd to paſs thoſe preſcrib'd limits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Holy man is ſaid to bid adieu to all his Friends, to the Vanities of this World, and to all obſtacles to Perfection, Mortifying all his Senſual Deſires; and yet not contented, reſolv'd to leave his Native Country, and accompanied with his Brethren, landed in a Province of <hi>Belgick Gaul,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by a People call'd the <hi>Morini,</hi> to whom he Preach'd the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> inſtructing many in the Perfection of a Holy Life. About thoſe parts there then liv'd a Prince call'd <hi>Mevorus,</hi> at or near a place call'd at this day <hi>Cormon:</hi> This Prince profeſs'd <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and having notice of the arrival of St. <hi>Gudwall</hi> within his Conſines, kindly receiv'd him. <hi>Mevorus</hi> and his Wife were much ſtricken in years, and had no Children; St. <hi>Gud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall</hi> in a Dream appear'd to the <hi>Matron,</hi> and promis'd her ſhe ſhould have a Son, which ſhould be call'd <hi>Simeon: Mevorus</hi> being inform'd by his Wife of this her Dream, promis'd that this Son when born, with all his Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Poſſeſſions, ſhould be aſſign'd to the Church and Monaſtery which this Holy Biſhop and Hermite, with the Treaſure of <hi>Mevorus</hi> was then building, probably near <hi>Ipre,</hi> where a Village call'd <hi>Ghelwelt</hi> ſeems to afford ſome Marks of St. <hi>Gudwall</hi>'s Name.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:96414:33"/>
            <p>The Son thus Promis'd, ſoon after was born, and call'd <hi>Simeon,</hi> brought up in Learning by St. <hi>Gudwall,</hi> made a <hi>Monk,</hi> and his Poſſeſſions confer'd on the Monaſtery. It is ſaid this Holy Biſhop, after all his Labours, reſted in our Lord about the year of Chriſt 403. It is written, that before his death an Angel of our Lord appear'd to him with a Pleaſant Countenance, ſaying, <hi>O worthy Soldier of God, may the joy of our Lord always encreaſe in thee, and his Peace continually remain with thee; be prepar'd, for e're long God will call thee out of this World, and thou ſhalt meet thy Heavenly King with a Palm of Victory:</hi> This Coeleſtial Meſſenger ſtay'd a good ſpace, filling his Soul with Spiritual Sweetneſs, known only to God.</p>
            <p>After this another Angel appear'd to him, and ſaid, <hi>I am</hi> Michael <hi>the Arch-Angel, ſent to thee from our Lord, to acquaint thee, That the hour of thy departure is at hand; for after ten days, thou ſhalt joyfully iſſue out of thy fleſhly Priſon, and eſcape out of the Dungeon of this World, and with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gladneſs thou ſhalt meet thy Heavenly King, into whoſe preſence we will bear thee; he will receive thee with Glory, and enroll thee among the Courtiers and Citizens of his Kingdom.</hi> Some ſay the Mother and Siſters of this Holy man were preſent and aſſiſting at his Death, invited thither by the Fame of his Miracles, and after his departure carried his Body back with them into <hi>Brittain;</hi> But when the <hi>Pagan Saxons</hi> demoliſh'd <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Sepulchres here, it was tranſported again into <hi>Flanders:</hi> The place of his Burial here, is ſaid to be the Iſle of <hi>Plet,</hi> or <hi>Plecit,</hi> where it remain'd many years, Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious by many Miracles, until it was tranſported to the place aforeſaid; where not being entertain'd with due Honour, it was by a Noble Marqueſs nam'd <hi>Arnulphus,</hi> after by Gods appointment, remov'd to the Monaſtery of <hi>

            <p>In the year of our Lord 342. great Commotions aroſe in <hi>Gaul</hi> by the coming in of the <hi>Franks,</hi> which were ſoon ſuppreſs'd; but <hi>Britain</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motions of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and being in diſorder, <hi>Conſtans</hi> was enforc'd to paſs over thither in the <hi>Winter</hi> Seaſon, and by his unlook'd for preſence there, ſoon frighted the Rebellious <hi>Iſlanders</hi> into Obedience.</p>
            <p>Four years after this, an unhappy <hi>Schiſm</hi> was like to break forth between the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches; for the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Biſhops of the Faction of <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> chief Pillar of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in two Synods at <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Antioch:</hi> On the contrary <hi>Julius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in a Synod of <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops receiv'd him into his Communion, notwithſtanding the interceſſion of the <hi>Orientals,</hi> who ſent their Decree of Condemnation to <hi>Rome.</hi> To prevent this <hi>Schiſm, Conſtans</hi> being Orthodox, ſollicited his Brother <hi>Conſtantius</hi> to joyn with him in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a General Councel, thereby to preſerve entirely the Heritage of their Fathers Piety, by which he had ſubdu'd many barbarous Nations, deſtroy'd Tyrants, and eſtabliſh'd the Empire.</p>
            <p>Hereupon a Synod was Aſſembled at <hi>Sardica</hi> in <hi>Illyrium,</hi> to which came out of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire about 300. Biſhops, and out of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> 76. only. Some of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Biſhops came out of <hi>Britain; Reſtitutus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was certainly one, who before at the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> conſented to the Faith of the <hi>Conſubſtantiality of the Son of God.</hi> It will not be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore impertinent to ſay ſomething of this great Councel, that the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches in thoſe days, to the Faith and Diſcipline of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96414:33"/>the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> may the better appear. This Synod firſt eſtabliſh'd the Faith of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel, next declar'd the Innocence of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and other Orthodox Biſhops perſecuted by the <hi>Arrian</hi> Faction, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of their Adverſaries and other <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Biſhops, who deſerted the Synod, and made a <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> Aſſembly at <hi>Philopolis,</hi> and in it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd contradictory Decrees.</p>
            <p>This Synod, as to matters of Diſcipline, Decreed this eſpecially, <hi>That Appeals be made in Caſe of Contention, to St.</hi> Peter<hi>'s Chair, ultimately to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by the</hi> Pope, <hi>or ſuch as he ſhould appoint in that behalf.</hi> Now it is certain, that the <hi>Donatists</hi> not long after, in Envy to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> endeavour'd to ſuppreſs the Acts of this famous Synod as much as they could, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> teſtifies: The Decrees of this Synod were after confirm'd by the Councel in <hi>Trullo.</hi> Another Decree was made, <hi>To reſtrain the Appeals of Deacons ſent by their Biſhops to the Emperour's Court, appointing them to preſent their Petitions to the Biſhop of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, to be by him examin'd whether juſt or not</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Synod being diſſolv'd, the Emperour <hi>Conſtans</hi> us'd his utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Authority for the Execution of theſe Decrees; his chiefeſt care was about the Reſtitution of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> whoſe return the Factious Biſhops of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> oppos'd: <hi>Conſtans</hi> wrote to his Brother for his Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mingling Threats, if he were not comply'd with, inſomuch, as that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> advis'd with many <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Biſhops about it: Who reſolv'd him, <hi>It was better to allow of</hi> Athanaſius, <hi>then hazard a Civil War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The year following, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> return'd into the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and was at firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by <hi>Conſtantius</hi> with ſome Kindneſs, and permitted to return to his See at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> But the year following the <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhops becoming boundleſs in their Power and Malice by the death of the Orthodox Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Conſtans,</hi> who by the Conſpiracy of <hi>Magnentius Chreſtius</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus</hi> was Traytorouſly ſlain, at <hi>Helena</hi> a Town in <hi>France:</hi> It is ſaid he had a Prediction, <hi>That he ſhould die in his Grand-Mothers Lap.</hi> His death was greatly bewail'd by St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who foreſaw the danger was like to enſue unto the <hi>Catholick Faith</hi> by the loſs of <hi>Conſtans,</hi> and the evil of the ſole remaining Emperour, who was yet at preſent, very much incumber'd by two Tyrants, the one was <hi>Vetranio,</hi> who had once govern'd in <hi>Britain,</hi> and was after Proclaim'd Emperour in <hi>Illyricum,</hi> but was ſoon depos'd by <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> who yet not only ſpar'd his Life, but ſuffer'd him to ſpend the remainder of his Life in Retirement full of Pleaſure and Abundance. The other Tyrant was <hi>Magnentius,</hi> who took the Title of Emperour at <hi>Augusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunum</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and held it three years, and then after the loſs of a Battel, was forc'd to kill himſelf.</p>
            <p>After this Victory, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> would be call'd the Emperour of the whole World, and aſſum'd the Impious Title of his Eternity; and then extended all his Pride and Power to oppreſs the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> and eſtabliſh the <hi>Arrian Hereſie</hi> even in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches alſo; commanding a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel to be Aſſembled at <hi>Arles</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where he extorted the Suffrages of the Biſhops, in favour of his <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and condemnation of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> drawing in the Legate of Pope <hi>Liberius,</hi> who had newly ſucceeded <hi>Julius.</hi> Howbeit <hi>Liberius</hi> more than once ſollicited the Emperour by <hi>Legates</hi> and <hi>Epiſtles</hi> on the behalf of St. <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> complaining, <hi>That the Suffrages of Biſhops were mercenarily ſold according to the Princes inclination.</hi>

            <p>Whereupon <hi>Conſtantius</hi> perceiving the endeavours of <hi>Liberius</hi> render'd the Sentences of his pack'd Synods invalid, ſought to win him by Promiſes and Favours to his Party; that proving ineffectual, he ſent for him; when <hi>Liberius</hi> was come to him, he ſtoutly proteſted, <hi>He would ſuffer any thing, rather than being a Chriſtian, to become an</hi> Arrian: At which the Emperour being offended, ſent him into Baniſhment to <hi>Beraea</hi> a City of <hi>Thrace;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he chearfully ſubmitted, rejecting 500 Crowns which the Emperour ſent for his Maintenance: In his place was ſubſtituted a certain <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſt call'd <hi>Felix,</hi> one, who though in judgement a <hi>Catholick,</hi> yet comply'd with the <hi>Arrians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liberius</hi> wanting conſtancy, and weary of his Baniſhment, after two years return'd from it, with as much Infamy, as he had ſubmitted to it with glory, yielding at laſt to the condemnation of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to a Confeſſion of Faith fram'd in a Synod at <hi>Sirmium;</hi> wherein, though there was nothing <hi>Haeretical,</hi> yet the word <hi>Conſubſtantiality</hi> being left out, his ſubſcription to it was ſcandalous, and argu'd an unlawful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with the <hi>Arrians.</hi> After all this returning again to <hi>Rome,</hi> he breaks off all Communion with the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and joyns himſelf in Communion with <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> to whom he thus writes, <hi>Our Confeſſion belov'd</hi> Athanaſius, <hi>is that the Word is the Son of God, being according to his Nature begotten of God his Father, not created; he is God, his Fathers Colleague in his Empire, and obtains an endleſs Kingdom for infinite Ages,</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>Whilſt <hi>Conſtantius</hi> in the <hi>Weſt</hi> thus afflicted the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church and Faith, <hi>Gratian</hi> Father of <hi>Valentinian</hi> afterwards Emperour, was Pro-Praetor of <hi>Britain:</hi> He was rais'd from a vile Original to this high degree for his Courage and Virtue; in his younger Age, he is ſaid to have been a Seller of Ropes, ſuch was his ſtrength, that five Soldiers were not able to wreſt a Rope out of his Hands; for his favouring <hi>Magnentius,</hi> he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd both of Office and Eſtate. <hi>Martinus</hi> ſucceeded him in his Pro-Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip of <hi>Britain,</hi> who govern'd this Iſland with great Juſtice and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the <hi>Britains,</hi> his Government was ſhortned upon this unhappy oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; <hi>Conſtantius</hi> being a Prince very Suſpitious, imploy'd Officers to ſearch out ſuch as were practiſing againſt him; One <hi>Paul</hi> a Notary was very much eſteem'd of him, for his Malicious Sagacity in ſuch matters, and therefore ſent by him into <hi>Britain,</hi> to bring over in Chains ſuch Soldiers as had intermedled in the Conſpiracy of <hi>Magnentius; Paul</hi> executed this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with ſuch Cruelty and Injuſtice, that the Pro-Praetor, to prevent the Miſeries of ſo many Innocents, firſt intercedes by way of Intreaty, and being therein unſucceſsful, proteſted he would leave the Province, rather than behold ſuch Oppreſſion. This <hi>Paul</hi> for his Subtilty call'd <hi>Catena;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus thwarted in his Cruelty, Craftily involves the Pro-praetor himſelf in a Suſpition of the ſame Guilt and Treaſon, ſo as he preſumes to ſeize upon him, and put him in Fetters with the reſt: <hi>Martinus</hi> betakes himſelf to his Sword in defence of himſelf, and therewith wounds <hi>Paul,</hi> but not Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally; and thereupon turns his Sword upon his own Breaſt, and ſo dy'd la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented of all men.</p>
            <p>In the year of our Lord 359. the Church of God was expos'd to great danger and infamy by the Councel of <hi>Ariminum</hi> then Aſſembled by the Authority of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperour <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> with deſign to aboliſh the Faith of the <hi>Conſubſtantiality of the Son of God.</hi> He commanded his Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Taurus, That when the Biſhops were met together, he ſhould not permit
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96414:34"/>them to depart, till they had all conſented in one Faith:</hi> It is ſaid, that out of <hi>Illyricum, Italy, Africk, Spain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> and out of <hi>Britain</hi> alſo, under the notion of <hi>Gaul,</hi> he gather'd together more than 400 Biſhops: The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour commanded allowance of Neceſſaries to theſe Biſhops; but thoſe of <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Britain</hi> refus'd it, as an unſeemly thing, and choſe rather at their own Coſts to maintain themſelves, Three only out of <hi>Britain</hi> excepted, who being deſtitute of Subſiſtence out of their own Sees, made ſome uſe of the Emperour's Liberality, and perhaps were not to be diſprais'd for it. Theſe Biſhops being aſſembled, were preſcrib'd what they ſhould do by the Emperours Letters, and ſeverely enjoyn'd to determine nothing which might touch the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Biſhops; and when they had finiſh'd their Decrees, they were to ſend them to Court by two Biſhops.</p>
            <p>In theſe Letters it is obſerv'd, that he Subſcribes himſelf <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> not <hi>Conſtantius:</hi> Notwithſtanding all which, the Holy Biſhops Couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly perform'd their Duties, for they confirm'd the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> ſorbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any addition or diminution thereof; and proteſting, <hi>They would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver depart from the Faith which they had receiv'd from God the Father by the Prophets and our Lord Jeſus Christ, which the Holy Spirit taught in the Goſpels, according as was deliver'd by Tradition of the Fathers ſucceeding the Apoſtles to the times when this Controverſie was debated at</hi> Nicaea, <hi>againſt an</hi> Hereſie <hi>which then aroſe.</hi> All the <hi>Catholick</hi> Biſhops in the Synod, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly ſubſcrib'd to this definition, wherein it is obſervable, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was grounded on the Holy Scriptures, yet thoſe Scriptures were interpreted by the ſucceſſive Tradition of the Church: Whereas, what the Faction of the <hi>Arrians</hi> ſeparately Decreed; according to the practice of other <hi>Hereticks,</hi> agreed only with the bare words of Scripture by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves interpreted.</p>
            <p>For as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> writes, in a <hi>Creed</hi> made by them, <hi>They profeſs the Son of God to be like the Father who begat him, whoſe Generation, according to the Scriptures, no man knows but the Father only.</hi> As for the word <hi>Subſtance,</hi> it being ſimply ſet down by the Fathers, not underſtood by the People, and occaſioning great Scandal, in as much as it is not expreſly contain'd in the Scriptures, they Decreed that it ſhould be quite aboliſh'd; and that for the future no mention ſhould be made of the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of God, becauſe the Holy Scriptures never mention the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Father and the Son; but they ſay, <hi>That the Son is in all things like the Father,</hi> as the Scriptures in their judgement teach.</p>
            <p>Now when the <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhops, of whom <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Vrſacius</hi> were chief, ſaw that they could not impoſe upon the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Biſhops, they ſeparated themſelves from the reſt of the Councel, and were thereupon pronounc'd by the unanimous Suffrages of the Orthodox Biſhops to be <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and excluded from the Communion of the Church; which done, the Councel by common Letter inform'd the Emperour of all theſe things. And whereas the <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhops to induce the <hi>Catholicks</hi> to comply with them, argued, <hi>That Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity would be reſtor'd to the Church, in caſe</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks <hi>ſhould relinquiſh that one word</hi> Subſtance. They therefore in their ſaid Letter inſerted, <hi>That it was not as</hi> Valens <hi>and</hi> Urſacius <hi>affirm'd, that Peace would follow, by the ſubverſion of things juſt and true; but that rather more contention would ariſe, both at</hi> Rome <hi>and other Cities: They therefore Pray'd, that the Councel might be diſſolv'd, conſidering the Poverty, Age and Infirmity of many Biſhops in it.</hi>

            <p>It is not likely that <hi>Arrianiſm</hi> ever took any great footing in this Iſland, for when St. <hi>Hilary</hi> was baniſh'd into <hi>Phrigia</hi> by the falſe ſuggeſtions of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turninus</hi> the <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> he wrote Letters to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops, eſpecially to the Aged <hi>Reſtitutus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> Congratulating and Commending their firmneſs in the Faith, that notwithſtanding the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temps of <hi>Saturninus</hi> to infect them, yet their conſtancy was famous over all the Empire; inſomuch, as ſome of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Biſhops became thereby aſham'd of their <hi>Hereſie.</hi> Howbeit, about this time this <hi>Reſtitutus</hi> being full of years, dy'd, and is worthily counted amongſt the Illuſtrious <hi>Britiſh</hi> Writers, and many Letters to St. <hi>Hilary</hi> are reckon'd to be of his writing.</p>
            <p>A further proof of the Orthodoxy of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church was St. <hi>Kebius,</hi> Sir-nam'd <hi>Corinius,</hi> Son of <hi>Solomon</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> who took a Journey into <hi>Gaul</hi> to St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> after his return from Exile, to be by him inſtructed more perfectly in the <hi>Catholick Faith: Copgrave</hi> in the Life of this Saint, ſays, <hi>That he abode ſeveral years with S.</hi> Hillary, <hi>improving himſelf in Learning and Sanctity; whereunto God gave Teſtimony, by conferring on him the Grace of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96414:35"/>Miracles, ſo that he gave Sight to the Blind, Cleans'd the Leprous, Cur'd thoſe which were Dumb, Heal'd the ſick of the Palſey, and thoſe who were poſseſs'd with Divels.</hi> Afterwards being admoniſh'd thereunto by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, having been Conſecrated Biſhop by St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> he return'd into his own Country, and plac'd his See in the Iſle of <hi>Angleſey;</hi> and by his good Example and ſound Doctrine, inſtructed the <hi>Northern</hi> People of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is He who was requeſted to take the Principality of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> but refus'd to accept of any Worldly Authority; and not long after, he is ſaid, <hi>To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend with ten Monks, who were his Diſciples, into a Meadow of King</hi> Ethelic, <hi>pitching his Tents there; wherewith, when the King was acquainted, he went with Company to caſt theſe Monks out of his Country; by the way he fell from his Horſe, which dy'd immediately, and both He and his Followers were ſtricken with blindneſs: Thereupon the King proſtrates himſelf before St.</hi> Kebius, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting himſelf to God and the Saint, by whoſe Prayers they were all preſently Healed.</hi> After this the King gave to the man of God two Churches, and he giving the King his Benediction, retir'd to <hi>Menevia,</hi> afterwards call'd St. <hi>David</hi>'s; from whence he ſail'd into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and having built a Church remain'd there four years: Very probable it is, that this St. <hi>Kebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> was that <hi>Britiſh</hi> Prieſt who Baptiz'd the <hi>Iriſh</hi> St. <hi>Albeus;</hi> for in his Life written by Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher:</hi> It is related, <hi>That</hi> Lachanus <hi>gave the Holy Child to certain</hi> Britains, <hi>who carefully brought him up, and gave him the Name of</hi> Albeus, <hi>becauſe he was found alive under a Rock, the Grace of God being with him.</hi> Not long after this, St. <hi>Kebius</hi> came into thoſe parts, ſent thither by the See Apoſtolick, many years before St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> to ſow the Faith of Chriſt there; but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being <hi>Pagans,</hi> he was receiv'd by few: He then went into <hi>Munſter,</hi> where he found this Holy Child <hi>Albeus,</hi> Praying in the open Air, with his Eyes rais'd up towards Heaven, that the true Faith might be reveal'd unto him, and ſaying, <hi>His deſire was to know the Creator of all things, and to believe in him who made Heaven and Earth; and declaring that the Elements could not be made without a skilful Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, nor be produc'd by any man:</hi> Theſe things being heard by this Holy Prieſt, he not only ſaluted, but inſtructed this Holy Child, Baptizing him, and continuing the ſame Name of <hi>Albeus</hi> to him. Several other Perſons were Converted, and Baptiz'd by him, as <hi>Meclarus</hi> and <hi>Kiaxanus,</hi> who prov'd eminent for Sanctity, and were after exalted to Epiſcopal Dignity, before the arrival of St. <hi>Patrick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After ſome years abode in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Holy Biſhop <hi>Kebius</hi> return'd to his See in <hi>Angleſey,</hi> where he dy'd in the year of Grace 370. The place of his Burial ſeems to be in <hi>Denbighſhire;</hi> for in the Story of St. <hi>Winefred,</hi> we read, <hi>That ſhe was buried near the Sepulchres of</hi> Chebaeus <hi>and</hi> Senanus, <hi>call'd</hi> Gwethern; Which <hi>Chebaeus</hi> was certainly our <hi>Kebius,</hi> whoſe memory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſtill, (ſaith <hi>Cambden</hi> in <hi>Angleſey;</hi>) where the Promontory call'd <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> is by the Natives nam'd <hi>Caer Gubi,</hi> from <hi>Kebius</hi> a Diſciple of St. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,</hi> whoſe memory is alſo there preſerv'd by another Promontory call'd <hi>Hilary-point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame year in which St. <hi>Kebius</hi> repair'd to St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> then newly return'd from baniſhment, was illuſtrious for the Birth of the great Apoſtle of <hi>Ireland</hi> St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> as moſt Authentick Authors agree; the place of his Birth is agreed to be in <hi>Britain</hi> by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelves. He is ſaid to be born in <hi>Pembrokeſhire,</hi> of <hi>Calphurnius</hi> and his Wife <hi>Concheſſa,</hi> Siſter or Siſters Daughter to St. <hi>Martin</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tours.</hi> After this Birth <hi>Calphur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:96414:36"/>became a Prieſt or Deacon, and profeſs'd Continency, as many others did.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Conſtantius</hi> dying of a Feavour in <hi>Cilicia, Julian</hi> having been created <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſucceeded him in the Empire, which he polluted by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Apoſtacy: He was from his Infancy bred in the Profeſſion of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> and inſcrib'd in the Eccleſiaſtical degree of a Lectorour; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an inconſtant curious diſpoſition, and unfortunately becoming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Pagan Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Magitians,</hi> he was by them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; and though during the Life of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> he diſſembled his change, yet being in poſſeſſion of the Empire, he publickly declar'd his defection from <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and an implacable hatred of it, with a reſolution to imploy all the Power of Earth and Hell for its deſtruction: The firſt proof hereof he gave, in taking away that famous <hi>Labarum,</hi> or Imperial Enſign of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> which in his Predeceſſors times, had given them aſſur'd Victories: In place whereof, he reſtor'd the Images of <hi>Heathen</hi> Gods or Devils, with the repreſentation of Eagles, Vultures, Minotaurs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Soldiers were commanded to Adore.</p>
            <p>All the Monuments of the <hi>Holy Croſs</hi> he endeavour'd to aboliſh, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he caus'd a Repreſentation of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to be dig'd up, on the top whereof <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had fix'd the <hi>Croſs,</hi> to denote the Felicity of his new City. He uſually objected to <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by way of Ignominy, <hi>That they left off to Adore and Worſhip the</hi> Ancilia <hi>which</hi> Jupiter <hi>let fall from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as a pledge of his Protection of their City; inſtead of which they Ador'd the Wood of the</hi> Croſs, <hi>painting Images thereof in their Forcheads, and before their Doors.</hi> Thus ſcoffing <hi>Julian</hi> cenſures the Rites of the Antient Church, and of the Faithful in his time, for their Veneration of that Bleſſed Inſtrument of our Redemption: All other Sacred Images and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues erected in memory of Divine Benefits, together with the Relicks of Saints and Martyrs, this Apoſtate endeavour'd to aboliſh; in particular, he caus'd that Miraculous Statue of our Saviour to be thrown down, which the devout Woman who had been Cur'd of her Bloody-Iſſue, had rais'd at <hi>Caeſarea Philippi;</hi> and in the place thereof erected his own, which not long after was divided in the midſt, and the upper-half thereof thrown all black to the ground, where it remain'd ſo for a long time.</p>
            <p>This Impious Emperour conſulting an Oracle at <hi>Daphne</hi> near <hi>Antioch,</hi> and perceiving the Devil in it to remain mute, ſave only that he was able to declare, <hi>That the Body of the Holy Martyr</hi> Babylas, <hi>hindred his Speech;</hi> Caus'd the Sacred Body to be remov'd into the City, which was done by the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with great Solemnity, in Singing Pſalms, eſpecially ſuch as derided Idolary; which ſo incens'd the Cruel Emperour, that he caus'd many of them to be Tormented; Howbeit, by the interceſſion of the Holy Martyr, their Torments were miraculouſly Converted, and melted into Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>A War againſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> interrupted his rage againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whoſe Extirpation he threat'ned at his return from that Expedition. In the heat of this War, <hi>Libanius</hi> a <hi>Heathen Sophiſter,</hi> in deriſion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Ask'd a Chriſtian, what the Carpenters Son was then doing,</hi> who anſwer'd, <hi>He is preparing a Coſſin for</hi> Julian. The event made the words Prophetical, for the wicked Emperour receiv'd from an unknown hand a Wound Mortal to himſelf, but Healthful to all the World beſides: In his place the Army choſe <hi>Jovian</hi> Emperour, which Honour he refus'd, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96414:36"/>
               <hi>That being a Chriſtian, he neither would, nor could govern an Army poiſon'd with</hi> Heatheniſh <hi>Idolatry:</hi> Whereupon all the Army cry'd out, <hi>That they alſo were Chriſtians:</hi> So that it ſeems the two years Reign of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> could not extirpate the good Seed ſown in their <hi>Roman</hi> Hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jovian</hi> thus choſen, reſtor'd the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, reducing the Church to its former Splendour: He publiſh'd a Law, by which, <hi>In all Cities a proportion of Wheat was contributed to Sacred Virgins by Vow Conſecrated to God: Another which inflicted Death on any who ſhould Raviſh, or but attempt their Chaſtity.</hi> There is extant an Epiſtle of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> in anſwer of one from this Emperour to him, wherein, <hi>He deſir'd the Judgement of the Saints, who among the divided Sects of Chriſtians retain'd the Orthodox Faith.</hi> Several Nations are mention'd in this Epiſtle, as conſtantly Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in the Faith of our Saviours Divinity eſtabliſh'd in the Councel of <hi>Nice;</hi> and amongſt the reſt, St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> makes an Honourable mention of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches. This Pious Emperour enjoy'd his Soveraignty but one year, and <hi>Valentinian</hi> equally Orthodox was his Succeſſor, yet unhappily he made his Brother <hi>Valens</hi> Partner in his Empire; He, infected with the <hi>Arrian Hereſie,</hi> prov'd Impiouſly Zealous in the promoting of it.</p>
            <p>In the firſt year of <hi>Valentinian</hi>'s Reign, the barbarous Nations on all ſides of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as if univerſally excited by a Trumpet, broke their limits, amongſt the reſt the <hi>Picts, Saxons, Scots</hi> and <hi>Attacotti</hi> vex'd the <hi>Brittains</hi> with inceſſant Calamities: Who the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> were, hath been before-declar'd; the <hi>Saxons</hi> as yet infeſted the Sea-ſhores, but who the <hi>Attacotti</hi> were, St. <hi>Jerom</hi> tells us, <hi>They were</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a Savage People upon the</hi> Northern <hi>Mountains of</hi> Scotland, <hi>who neglecting Beeves and other Cattle fed themſelves with Humane Fleſh as their principal Delicacies, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Law or Government; and who had promiſcuous Wives and hildren in common;</hi> Theſe were eaſily induc'd to joyn with the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> againſt the Civil <hi>Britains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperour (<hi>Valentinian</hi> to ſuppreſs theſe Incurſions,) leaving his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Valens</hi> to govern in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> made an Expedition into <hi>Gaul,</hi> where, having compos'd great Troubles, he met with very ill News from <hi>Britain;</hi> ſo as he ſent one of his Principal Officers to remedy thoſe Diſorders there; at laſt more horrible Rumours increaſing, he made choice of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to go General thither, a Man Famous for many Martial Exploits; who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Courageous Legions, proſecuted the Expedition with a Noble Confidence: The <hi>Saxons</hi> not only Infeſted the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Coaſts, but made an impreſſion even to <hi>London;</hi> To remedy which injuries, the vigilant General <hi>Theodoſius</hi> being landed near <hi>Sandwich</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> with his Co-horts, march'd ſtreight to <hi>London,</hi> and dividing his Army into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Squadrons, ſet upon the ſtragling Enemies loaden with Spoils, and diſperſing them, Reſcu'd the Priſoners with the Cattle and other Prey, which he reſtor'd to the miſerable Natives; except ſome ſmall part of it, that was beſtow'd upon his wearied Soldiers: He then enter'd the City in Triumph, and was joyfully receiv'd by the People recover'd from their Miſery by his Valour; while he ſtay'd there, having intimation that ſo many fierce Nations could not be better ſuppreſs'd than by ſubtilty; to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them therefore, he publiſhed Edicts, promiſing Pardon to ſuch as would ſubmit: Thoſe which came in, he diſpers'd into Quarters ſeverally, well providing for them, which encourag'd many more to ſubmit.</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:96414:37"/>
            <p>He ſent to the Emperour, that <hi>Civilis</hi> might be ſent over as his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty-Governour in <hi>Britain,</hi> and <hi>Dulcitius</hi> as his Lieutenant in Martial Affairs, and well skill'd therein: And two years after he march'd <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and put to flight ſeveral Nations, who invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces, and reſtor'd Peace to many Cities which had been vex'd with many troubles: There was then in <hi>Britain</hi> one <hi>Valentinus</hi> a <hi>Pannonian,</hi> baniſh'd into <hi>Britain</hi> for great Crimes, who had like to have circumvented <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> by Treaſon after all his Conqueſts; for this <hi>Valentinus</hi> being of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and turbulent Spirit, ſollicited many of the Soldiers to Conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; But this deſign being diſcover'd, the good General, contented himſelf with the Death of <hi>Valentinus</hi> and his neareſt Aſſociates, leaſt by ſearching too far into the Conſpiracy, he might ſtir up a Mutiny in his Army. This danger eſcap'd, he ſo ſucceſsfully proſecuted the War, that he recover'd all the Provinces from the Enemies, and ſecur'd them by ſtrong Garriſons, and a particular Governour.</p>
            <p>So that now, ſo much of <hi>Britain</hi> as was under the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominion, became divided into five Provinces; The firſt call'd <hi>Britania prima,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all the <hi>Southern</hi> parts from the <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Thames</hi> to the <hi>Severn;</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Britania ſecunda,</hi> comprehending all <hi>Wales;</hi> the third call'd <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via Caeſarienſis</hi> (probably from the Son of this <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> afterwards Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of the <hi>Flavian</hi> Family) embracing all the Regions to the River <hi>Humber;</hi> the fourth call'd <hi>Maxima Caeſarienſis,</hi> reaching from <hi>Humber</hi> to the River <hi>Tine:</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> having repell'd the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> out of all the Provinces beyond <hi>Tine,</hi> as far as <hi>Dunbritton</hi> and <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> call'd the fifth Province <hi>Valentia,</hi> wherein a <hi>Roman</hi> Legion Winter'd to repreſs the Incurſions of the <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> having thus Happily ſettled <hi>Britain,</hi> was two years after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd by the Emperour to <hi>Rome,</hi> and made General of the Horſe; as alſo Honour'd with a Statue of <hi>Braſs</hi> by the Senate, and at laſt by his eminent Exploits, recommended his Son to the Empire.</p>
            <p>The year after the departure of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> from this Iſland, our Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Monuments Commemorate St. <hi>Ninias</hi> his Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to be inſtructed in the Orthodox Faith; and whither it is probable he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> Which Faith afterwards, with great efficacy, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to his Country-men. This <hi>Ninias</hi> was born in <hi>Britain</hi> of a Princely Stock in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> who then had its peculiar King; his Father was a <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> In Childhood he was Sober, ſparing of his Tongue, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in Reading, Grave in Converſation, careful to ſubject the Fleſh to the Spirit; He alſo ſhew'd great Devotion to Churches: At the laſt, by a forcible inſtinct of Gods Spirit, deſpiſing the World and Carnal Affections, he Travell'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there addreſs'd himſelf to <hi>Pope Damaſus</hi> and declar'd the Cauſe of his Journey; whereupon the Holy Biſhop appointed him Teachers in the wholeſom ſenſe of Scriptures, by whom he was inſtructed in true Wiſdom, to the Comfort and Profit of others.</p>
            <p>To this time is refer'd the memory of St. <hi>Augulus,</hi> born in <hi>London,</hi> Biſhop and Martyr; as alſo of St. <hi>Moyſes,</hi> ſaid alſo to be born in <hi>Britain,</hi> Famous for many Miracles; who, after a Solitary Life in the Deſart, was made Biſhop of the <hi>Saracens;</hi> and after he had Converted many of that Nation to the Orthodox Faith, he there dy'd in Peace.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:96414:37"/>
            <p>To <hi>Valentinian</hi> ſucceeded his Son <hi>Gratian,</hi> who nine years before had been nam'd <hi>Auguſtus</hi> by his Father, and about ſix days after his younger Brother <hi>Valentinian</hi> was ſaluted Emperour by the Soldiers, with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of <hi>Gratian.</hi> And now the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> began to make Incurſions into <hi>Britain</hi> again, in one of which they led Captive with them the Child of <hi>Calphurnius, Socher</hi> call'd afterwards <hi>Patrick</hi> in the 16th. year of his Age, whom they Sold to a Nobleman in the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> call'd <hi>Milchu;</hi> he Imploy'd the Holy Youth in keeping his Swine, to be try'd betimes in the Furnace of Affliction; for ſix years the Devout Youth ſpent in this Slavery; in which time, nevertheleſs God wrought great Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by him. St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Imployment withdrawing him from Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of men, afforded him the more ſpace to attend upon God: He is ſaid to addreſs his Prayers to God a hundred times a day, and as often by night; to his Prayers he added Faſting for the Mortification of his Senſes, with theſe two wings he mounted to ſuch Perfection, that he enjoy'd a frequent Converſation of Angels; inſomuch, as an Angel call'd <hi>Victor</hi> frequently viſited him, and told him, <hi>He did well to Faſt, and that e're long he ſhould return into his Country.</hi> Let no man wonder at this unuſual Name of an Angel, for as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> obſerves, <hi>Angels are deſign'd by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Names, to ſignifie their particular Virtucs and Operations;</hi> And this of <hi>Victor</hi> might intimate to St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> that firſt he ſhould Conquer his own Tribulations, and then the Power of the Devil in that Idolatrous Nation.</p>
            <p>The Patience and Virtues of this Young man, mov'd the goodneſs of God, to free him from this Captivity; for after ſix years, <hi>Patrick</hi> by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice from an Angel, found under a Turf, a ſum of Gold, by which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd himſelf from his Slavery, and return'd to his Parents and Country, which he gloriouſly Illuſtrated with the admirable Sanctity of his Life.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Valens</hi> the <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperour ſuffer'd a ſevere Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his Perſecution of the Orthodox Faith; for the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Hunns,</hi> fierce <hi>Northern</hi> Nations, entring into <hi>Thrace,</hi> put the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Empire in great danger; <hi>Valens</hi> thereupon requir'd Aid of <hi>Gratian,</hi> who came on with the Holy Sign of the <hi>Croſs, in the Name of the true God to his Aſſiſtance;</hi> but <hi>Valens</hi> not ſtaying his coming, out of envy, leaſt he ſhould partake any glory in the Victory, would needs hazard Battle alone with the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> by whom his Army was diſcomfited and himſelf wounded with a Dart, and flying with his chief Officers into a Houſe, his purſuing Enemies ſet it on fire, which conſum'd him and his Company: In his place the Emperour <hi>Gratian</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> unwilling to leave the <hi>Weſt,</hi> aſſum'd <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> the worthy Son of that famous <hi>Theodoſius</hi> who ſettled <hi>Britain</hi> and repreſs'd its Enemies into a part of the Empire, and committed to him the care of defending the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Regions againſt the inſulting <hi>Goths.</hi>

            <p>Thus <hi>Maximus</hi> having ſubdu'd both <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> and thereby at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiev'd great Glory, being vex'd at the promotion of the younger <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> to the Empire, began to incenſe the Soldiers againſt the Emperour, and receiv'd from them the Imperial Purple: Had he not attain'd this Title againſt his Oath and Fidelity, he was a Prince ſo Juſt and Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, he might have been thought worthy to have been Emperour.</p>
            <p>Being thus advanc'd, he paſs'd over into <hi>Gaul,</hi> which paſſage prov'd fatal to this Iſland, from whence he tranſported, not only the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies, but the flower alſo of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> youth, which never return'd, ſo as <hi>Britain,</hi> thus diſpoil'd of Military Forces, became expos'd to the miſerable and cruel Incurſions of their <hi>Northern</hi> Enemies, the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts: Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> attended with ſo great a force, quickly ſubdu'd both <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and by a Treaſonable Stratagem ſlew the Emperour <hi>Gratian</hi> at <hi>Lyons,</hi> and march'd ſtraight into <hi>Italy</hi> againſt <hi>Valentinian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems now was the time when <hi>Britain</hi> became infected with <hi>Herefie</hi> and greedy of Novelties; the occaſion might be, the ſevere dealing of <hi>Maximus</hi> in <hi>Gaul</hi> againſt the Arch-Heretick <hi>Priſcillian</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions <hi>Juſtantius</hi> and <hi>Tiberianus:</hi> Theſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> reviv'd a new <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi> out of the dregs of the Antient <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> and <hi>Manichees,</hi> which at firſt infected <hi>Spain,</hi> then attempted <hi>Italy,</hi> and being there rejected by <hi>Pope Damaſus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and by St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> at <hi>Milan:</hi> The Infection began to ſpread in <hi>Gaul;</hi> Complaint being made to <hi>Maximus</hi> by the <hi>Gallican</hi> Biſhops, a Synod was Aſſembled at <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> by which <hi>Juſtantius</hi> was Depos'd; <hi>Priſcilian</hi> Appeal'd to the Emperour, who at the inſtigation of ſome Biſhops, became ſevere againſt the <hi>Hereticks;</hi> but by the interceſſion of St. <hi>Martin</hi> grew more mild, abſtaining from ſhedding of Blood; yet afterward <hi>Priſcilian</hi> Convicted of <hi>Magick,</hi> and many filthy Doctrines and Practices, <hi>As Praying Naked in a meeting of Women at night,</hi> &amp;c. was Condemned with other his Aſſociates, to looſe his Head, only <hi>Juſtantius</hi> is ſaid to be baniſh'd to the Iſle of <hi>Silly,</hi> with <hi>Tiberianus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Teachers of this Impure <hi>Hereſie</hi> being placed ſo near the Confines of <hi>Britain,</hi> no wonder if Doctrines favouring the Inclinations of corrupt Nature, did quickly inſinuate into unwary Minds, affected with Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And indeed this Scandalouſly ſevere judgement, hitherto unpractic'd in the Church, was ſo far from cutting off the <hi>Hereſie,</hi> that it rather gave ſtrength; for his followers Honour'd him as a Holy man, and Worſhip'd him as a Martyr.</p>
            <p>The Emperour <hi>Maximus,</hi> for that Title <hi>Theodoſius</hi> allow'd him after the Death of <hi>Gratian,</hi> was ſo zealous in defence of the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> that he wrote an efficacious Letter in the behalf of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Valentinian,</hi> (who by the inſtigation of his Mother <hi>Juſtina,</hi> perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Holy Biſhop,) and denounc'd War againſt him, unleſs he would deſiſt from his unjuſt perſecution. <hi>Maximus</hi> with his Wife alſo, had a great reſpect for the Bleſſed Biſhop of <hi>Tours</hi> St. <hi>Martin;</hi> ſome have thought this Lady, (who ſo much Honour'd St. <hi>Martin,</hi>) was of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Extract, and the rather therefore is ſhe here mention'd.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Maximus</hi> not content with ſo large a Portion of Empire in <hi>Gaul, Spain</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> march'd with his Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> at whoſe approach <hi>Valentinian</hi> fled into <hi>Illyricum,</hi> and then learn'd by experience, how unhappy he was in following his Mothers advice againſt the Holy Biſhop St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi>

            <p>There is a Letter extant written by <hi>Maximus</hi> to <hi>Siricius</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Damaſus,</hi> wherein he profeſſeth the Orthodox Faith, wherein he was Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd, and ſoon after Proclaim'd Emperour; and in this Letter he inveighs againſt the <hi>Priſcillianites,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Manichces, Whoſe abominable Doctrines and Crimes were ſo Enormous, even by their own Confeſſion, in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Modeſty forbids the further relation of them.</hi>

               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſollicited by <hi>Valentinian,</hi> whoſe Siſter <hi>Galla</hi> he had Married, came with an Army into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> preparing himſelf for the War by Earneſt Prayerand Faſting; and having heard of a certain <hi>Monk</hi> in the Deſerts of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> a Servant of God, who had the Spirit of Prophecy, ſent to him, and receiv'd from him an aſſurance of Victory, which he ſoon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd againſt <hi>Maximus,</hi> who only wanted a good Cauſe; thus Conquer'd he was brought before <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who had a mind to pitty him, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which, the Soldiers remov'd him from the Emperour's Preſence, and ſlew him, and ſo expiated the death of the Innocent <hi>Gratian,</hi> whom his Son <hi>Victor</hi> ſoon follow'd to the Grave, after he had been made <hi>Caeſar.</hi>

            <p>It will afford us a clear proſpect of the judgement and practice of the Antient Church, if ſomewhat be ſhortly related from the Mouth and Pen of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which happen'd about two years before he was Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Baptiz'd by St. <hi>Ambroſe; Who being under the ſevere Perſecution of</hi> Juſtina <hi>the</hi> Arrian <hi>Empreſs, it pleas'd God in a Viſion then to diſcover to that Holy Biſhop, the place wherein the Bodies of the Martyrs</hi> Protaſius <hi>and</hi> Gerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius <hi>repos'd, and had been there preſerv'd incorrupt for many years, by which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery the rage of this Empreſs was much reſtrain'd. For theſe Holy Bodies being with due Honour tranſlated to the</hi> Ambroſian <hi>Church, not only many vex'd with unclean Spirits, were heal'd, but a Citizen of</hi> Milan <hi>who had been blind many years, hearing the noiſe and acclamations of the People, deſir'd to be led to the ſaid Church, and there obtain'd leave with his Handkercheif to touch the Coffin of thoſe Martyrs, and wiping his Eyes with the ſaid Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercheif, they were immediately open'd, ſo as he ſaw clearly, to the joy and aſtoniſhment of the Beholders and whole City; and although the fame hereof did nat heal the Empreſs fully of her Spiritual Blindneſs, yet it allay'd her fury againſt the Holy Biſohp.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf then at <hi>Milan</hi> gives a large teſtimony of theſe Miracles, as alſo doth St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> himſelf, who fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo declares, <hi>That the Devils themſelves upon this occaſion caſt out, confeſs'd it to be done by the Power and Virtue of the Martyrs, which they were not able to reſiſt, but to their exceſſive torment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after this, St. <hi>Augustine</hi> is ſaid to have return'd to his own Country in <hi>Africk,</hi> but by the way at <hi>Ostia,</hi> to have loſt his Bleſſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Monica,</hi> of whom in his Confeſſions he writes, <hi>That when the day of her Diſſolution was at hand, ſhe made it her requeſt that Commemoration ſhould be made of her at Gods Altar, from whence ſhe knew the Holy Sacrifice and Victim was diſpens'd, and by which ſhe hop'd to blot out the Hand-writing againſt her, and joyfully to Triumph over the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the death of <hi>Maximus, Theodoſius</hi> left <hi>Valentinian</hi> Emperour of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> adding to his Government <hi>Gaul, Britain</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> infeſted with Tyrants: But before he entruſted him with this great Charge, the Pious Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> inſtructed him in the Orthodox Faith, which he the more eaſily did, in regard <hi>Juſtina Valentinian</hi>'s Mother, was then lately dead: The year following broke forth an <hi>Hereſie,</hi> ſince renew'd by <hi>Luther, Juſtifying ſuch as renounc'd their Monaſtical Profeſſion, and approving the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96414:39"/>Embraces of Conſecrated Nuns: Jovinian</hi> an Apoſtate <hi>Monk,</hi> was the Author of this <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and publickly was declar'd an <hi>Heretick</hi> for it by <hi>Pope Siricius.</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> wrote againſt this <hi>Hereſie</hi> in particular, St. <hi>Hierom</hi> terms it, <hi>Venemous Doctrine in three reſpects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>For that it affirms, Virgins, Widdows and Married Women, being Baptiz'd to be of the ſame merit, in caſe they differ not in other works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That thoſe who with a compleat Faith have been Regenerated by Baptiſm, cannot afterwards be ſubverted by the Devil.</hi>

               <hi>Siricius</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Milan</hi> gives this Character of <hi>Jovinian, That he was an Imitator of the Devil, an Enemy of Chaſtity, a Teacher of Luxury, a hater of Abſtinence, and lover of Gluttony.</hi> In oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which Doctrine, a Synod is aſſembled by the ſame Holy <hi>Pope,</hi> wherein is declar'd, <hi>That the Vows of Marriage are not to be diſparag'd, yet greater Honour is to be attributed to the Spiritual Marriage of Virgins: That</hi> Jovinian<hi>'s opinion was contrary to the Chriſtian Law, and Tradition of the Church; and therefore</hi> Jovinian <hi>and all his Complices were condemn'd of</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie <hi>and</hi> Blaſphemy <hi>by this Synod, and by their Sentence caſt out of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in a Synodical Anſwer of the Church of <hi>Milan</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> tells him, <hi>That thoſe</hi> Hereticks <hi>who then fled to</hi> Milan, <hi>were avoided by all, as if they had been infected with the Plague, and thruſt out of the City like Vagabonds.</hi> And St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> reciting the Poſitions of this <hi>Hereſie,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>That Holy Church had moſt Fruitfully and Couragiouſly reſiſted this Monſter.</hi> And in truth it was ſoon extinguiſh'd; neither doth this <hi>Hereſie</hi> ever appear to have crept into this Iſland in thoſe times, ſo precious and Venerable was Virginity, eſpecially here, that Faſting and Abſtinence were frequently us'd, and Seminaries of Chaſtity in great numbers Erected and Plentifully Endow'd.</p>
            <p>The young Emperour <hi>Valentinian,</hi> after a troubleſome reign of four years, was ſlain near <hi>I yons;</hi> before his death he deſir'd Baptiſm, but liv'd not to obtain it. After his Death the Tyrant <hi>Eugenius</hi> invaded the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire: He pretended to be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but was indeed addicted to <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Superſtitions; he was ſoon ſlain by <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who prepar'd himſelf to encounter this Tyrant; not ſo much by Force of Arms, as with Prayer and Faſting: He kept watch rather in the Church then the Camp, lying proſtrate, in the Company both of his Prieſts and People, before the Monuments of the Apoſtles and Martyrs cover'd with Sack-cloth, and begging Divine aſſiſtance. The General employ'd in this Expedition was <hi>Stilico,</hi> call'd out of <hi>Britain,</hi> after he had freed the Country from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> and planted a <hi>Roman</hi> Legion to ſecure the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Borders.</p>
            <p>The Holy young man St. <hi>Ninian</hi> before mention'd, about this time, ſhew'd forth the Glorious Fruits of his Pious Education under the Holy <hi>Popes Damaſus</hi> and <hi>Siricius.</hi> for he then was newly Conſecrated Biſhop, and ſent back into his own Country, to Preach the Saving Truths of Chriſts Goſpel to the rude Nation of the <hi>Southern Picts,</hi> ſeated between <hi>Cumberland</hi> and the Bay of <hi>Dunbritton:</hi> This man of God in his return from <hi>Rome,</hi> was deſirous to viſit the Glorious Biſhop St. <hi>Martin</hi> at <hi>Tours,</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:96414:39"/>by whom he was Honourably receiv'd, and very much eſteem'd, as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of extraordinary Sanctity, and like to prove a Happy Inſtrument of Salvation to many: Being diſmiſs'd by St. <hi>Martin,</hi> he arriv'd at the place where he deſign'd to ſettle, and there found a great concourſe of People, who it ſeems had notice of his return, and readily receiv'd him with great Joy and Devotion, as a great Prophet. He firſt began to root up their ill planted Superſtitions, to diſperſe their long gather'd wicked Cuſtoms, and to demoliſh their impious Idolatries; and having ſo purg'd their minds from Errour, he inſtructed them in all the Duties belonging to good <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> and by his works and example, ſhew'd them a pattern of all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Piety, confirming all by frequent Miracles: He choſe for his ſeat of Epiſcopal reſidence, a place afterward call'd <hi>Witehern</hi> ſeated near the Sea, by which almoſt encompaſs'd, it hath only one paſſage to it toward the <hi>North,</hi> and as (ſaith <hi>Cambden</hi>) <hi>Is in the Province of the</hi> Novantes, <hi>now call'd</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway: This Epiſcopal Seat by the <hi>Latin</hi> Writers, is nam'd <hi>Candida Caſa,</hi> or the <hi>White-houſe,</hi> and was here Erected by <hi>Ninianus</hi> in the time of this <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> And thus as St. <hi>Bede</hi> alſo confirms, <hi>The</hi> Southern Picts <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the true Faith by the Preaching of this Holy man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many years he ſpent in his Apoſtolical Office, for his death enſu'd not, till 38 years, after his firſt entrance: He Conſecrated Biſhops, ordain'd Prieſts dividing the Country into Pariſhes. More will be ſaid of him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when his Death is to be related; obſerving this only by the way, that <hi>Galloway</hi> at that time belong'd to the juriſdiction of the <hi>Britains,</hi> not of the <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Labours of St. <hi>Ninianus,</hi> were no doubt much eas'd by the Arrival of another Saint, who by Divine inſpiration came thither out of <hi>Achaia,</hi> bringing with him the precious Relicks of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Andrew.</hi> This Saint named St. <hi>Regulus,</hi> as <hi>Hector Boetius</hi> relates, <hi>Watching one night at the Monument of St.</hi> Andrew, <hi>was admoniſh'd from Heaven to take off the Holy Apoſtles Arm, three Fingers, and as many Joynts of one of his Feet, and laying them Decently in a Veſſel, to carry them to the Iſland of</hi> Albion <hi>or</hi> Britain, <hi>ſeated in the Confines of the World; becauſe in future times, there would live a People, which would give great Veneration to that Apoſtle, and by his Interceſſion receive great Graces and Benefits, both Earthly and Heavenly through the Divine goodneſs.</hi> In complyance with which admonition, the Holy man undertook that tedious Journey: The Report of his arrival with that Sacred Treaſure, being ſpread through the Regions of the <hi>Picts,</hi> inflam'd the minds of many to ſee and venerate thoſe Holy Relicks, <hi>Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that</hi> (as <hi>Boetius</hi> relates) <hi>the People flock'd together from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, bringing Gifts and Offerings to the Holy Apoſtle.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Herguſtus</hi> or <hi>Hungas</hi> their King, invited with the fame of theſe things, came alſo to viſit this Holy man <hi>Regulus,</hi> who receiv'd him with a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Proceſſion, in which Prieſts and Monks Sang Hymns and Praiſes to God. <hi>The King</hi> (as the ſame Author writes) <hi>falling Proſtrate on the the ground, with great veneration kiſs'd the Sacred Relicks; and when all the Holy Rites were perform'd after the</hi> Chriſtian <hi>manner, he freely beſtow'd his Royal Palace, to the Honour of St.</hi> Andrew <hi>upon</hi> Regulus <hi>and the Prieſts with him; and alſo built a Church not far from thence, Dedicated to the ſame Apoſtle, for the performance of Divine Service: This is the place, where in followiug Ages the Primates of</hi> Scotland <hi>eſtabliſh'd their Arch-Epiſcopal See.

Pattens, Copes, Chalices, Baſons, Lavers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>fram'd of Silver and Gold:</hi> Some modern Writers queſtion the Truth of this Story, out of an averſion perhaps to Sacred Relicks; However <hi>Pope Boniface</hi> the VIII. in an Epiſtle to <hi>Edward</hi> the I. writes plainly thus, <hi>Your Royal Highneſs may pleaſe to underſtand, that the Kingdom of</hi> Scotland <hi>was Converted to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Catholick Faith by the venerable Relicks of St.</hi> Andrew <hi>the Apoſtle: Such</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was the great goodneſs of Almighty God.</hi> The <hi>Picts</hi> call'd the Prieſts which came with St. <hi>Regulus Coldei</hi> or <hi>Colidei, Worſhipers of God;</hi> To theſe others from among the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> joyn'd themſelves, leading a Solitary life; <hi>With ſuch fame of their Sanctity</hi> (ſaith <hi>Buchanan</hi>) <hi>that being dead, their Cells were Converted to Churches:</hi> Although in Truth, if we ſpeak of the prime Original of theſe <hi>Coldei,</hi> they began in the times of Perſecution under <hi>Diocleſian.</hi> The Geſts of this St. <hi>Regulus</hi> are Celebrated in the <hi>Engliſh Martyrology,</hi> which ſome miſtake only as to the time of his death.</p>

            <p>In the IV. year of <hi>Honorius, Pope Siricius</hi> dy'd, to whom ſucceeded <hi>Anaſtaſius, Aman</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Hierom</hi>) <hi>of rich Poverty and Apoſtolick Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;</hi> He mainly oppos'd the Error of <hi>Origen,</hi> then creeping into <hi>Rome,</hi> and made an Edict, directed eſpecially to the Vicar of <hi>Britain, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he utterly forbad the Offering of</hi> Pagan <hi>Sacrifices, yet his pleaſure was, that the Ornaments of publick Works, though repreſenting</hi> Pagan <hi>Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhould be preſerv'd.</hi> This Iſland at this time, ſeems to ſit at eaſe; ſecur'd from the Violence of its <hi>Northern</hi> Enemies by a <hi>Roman</hi> Legion quarter'd in the Borders, and govern'd by <hi>Marcus</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> General, ſent thither by <hi>Honorius:</hi> The Poet <hi>Claudian</hi> in his Panegyrick to <hi>Stilico,</hi> gives teſtimony of this then Peaceable eſtate.</p>
            <p>But alas this Calm laſted but a little while, for the Troubles ariſing in <hi>Italy,</hi> occaſion'd the Forces which defended <hi>Britain</hi> to be call'd home; and theſe troubles were caus'd by the Invaſion of <hi>Alaricus</hi> King of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> to which <hi>Stilico</hi> gave ſome ſtop, vanquiſhing the <hi>Gothes</hi> in a Battle to their utter ruine; if <hi>Stilico</hi> to promote his Ambitions deſigns, had not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to retire back into <hi>Pannonia,</hi> that he might continue in poſſeſſion of the Emperour's Forces: And indeed upon a ſecond Invaſion of theſe Barbarous Enemies, another Battle was fought by <hi>Stilico,</hi> who once more overcame them; and to this Battle the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions which defended <hi>Brittain</hi> were drawn from thence.</p>

            <p>Theſe <hi>Hereſies</hi> began to appear in publick about the years 404, and 405. notice thereof being taken by <hi>Pope Innocentius: Pelagius</hi> prepar'd a Letter of Purgation, preſented to <hi>Zoſimus</hi> Succeſſor of <hi>Innocentius:</hi> His Doctrines being every where reprov'd, he Appeal'd to the Judgement of a Lawful Synod, but one of the Biſhops appointed to Accuſe him falling ſick, and ſo not able to appear at <hi>Lidda,</hi> where the Synod was Aſſembled; <hi>Pelagius</hi> gave ſuch Cautelous Anſwers to the Propoſals of the Biſhops there preſent, that he eſcap'd Cenſure, and was accounted Orthodox: Howbeit, at the ſame time his prime Diſciple <hi>Caeleſtius</hi> was Condemn'd for his <hi>Hereſies</hi> at <hi>Carthage,</hi> in a Synod there held; from which he Appeal'd to the <hi>Roman</hi> See, but not daring to purſue his Appeal, he fled into <hi>Aſia,</hi> where by fraud he obtain'd the degree of a Prieſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe Errors were afterwards condemn'd at a Synod held at <hi>Milevis</hi> in <hi>Numidia,</hi> and both Condemnations were approv'd by <hi>Pope Innocentius,</hi> who Excommunicated as well <hi>Pelagius</hi> as <hi>Caeleſtius;</hi> yet ſo as upon their revoking their Errours, they might be reſtor'd to <hi>Catholick</hi> Communion: Nevertheleſs their <hi>Hereſies</hi> ſtill ſpreading, the <hi>African</hi> Biſhops of both Councels, deputed St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to confute them, which Charge he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd to his great Renown.</p>
            <p>Both theſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> cloak'd their Doctrines in Ambiguity of words and endeavour'd to ſurprize the <hi>Popes</hi> by a diſſembled ſubmiſſion to their Judgements; but their fraud being detected, and their Tergiverſations at laſt diſcover'd, <hi>Pope Zoſimus</hi> again Condemn'd their Doctrine, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated their Perſons; which Sentence was Solemnly pronounc'd by <hi>Sixtus</hi> a <hi>Roman Prieſt,</hi> not long after <hi>Pope,</hi> whom the <hi>Pelagians</hi> eſteem'd their Patron, but without cauſe.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Hereſie</hi> having been Proſcrib'd by ſo many Synods, and more than once by the <hi>Roman</hi> See; the Emperour <hi>Honorius</hi> publiſh'd an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial <hi>Sanction,</hi> by which he not only Baniſh'd <hi>Caeleſtius</hi> and <hi>Pelagius</hi> out of <hi>Rome,</hi> but ordain'd, <hi>That the Teachers thereof ſhould incurre the ſame Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Notwithſtanding all this care, yet inregard this ſo execrable an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi> favour'd the Corruption of Nature, and Humane Pride, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality; it continu'd in many Countries, eſpecially in <hi>Britain,</hi> ſo as the Churches of <hi>Gaul</hi> thought fit to ſend two Eminent Biſhops thither.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time another Infamous <hi>Heretick Vigilantius,</hi> infected <hi>Gaul</hi> alſo; St. <hi>Hierom</hi> would rather have him call'd <hi>Dormilantius,</hi> for that being full of an unclean Spirit, he went about to Combat againſt the Spirit of Chriſt, by teaching, <hi>That the Sepulchres of Martyrs were not to be venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, , and condemning the Devout</hi> Vigils <hi>Celebrated before the Feſtivals of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96414:41"/>Gods Saints:</hi> He likewiſe with <hi>Jovinian, Declaim'd againſt Faſting, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd Riches before voluntary Poverty, and Marriage before Virginity;</hi> which Errours, ſaith St. <hi>Jerom, Were deteſted by the whole Catholick World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year of Grace 406. the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> waſted the Confines of <hi>Britain; Marcus</hi> was then Governour, whom on a ſuddain the Army Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Emperour; but the inconſtant Soldiers finding his Incapacity, as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly depos'd him, and choſe <hi>Gratianus</hi> born in this Iſland: Him alſo within four Months they ſlew; which being divulg'd abroad, <hi>Scots, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wegians</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> march'd Croſs the Iſland, waſting all with Fire and Sword.</p>
            <p>In this extremity the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Army proclaim'd a Soldier call'd <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Emperour, not for merit, but the fancy of his Name, as if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ruines could not be repair'd but by another <hi>Conſtantine: Geffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> tells another Story of the Election of this <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> as if he had been Brother to a King of <hi>Armorica</hi> or <hi>Little-Britain</hi> of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; this indeed is little better then a meer Fiction.</p>
            <p>For firſt this <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> as <hi>Bede</hi> witneſſeth, was choſen, <hi>Ex infima Militia,</hi> out of the loweſt rank of the Army.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He directed Meſſengers to <hi>Honorius,</hi> to excuſe himſelf, as compell'd by the Soldiers to accept the Title.</p>
            <p>Howbeit this <hi>Conſtantine</hi> paſſes over into <hi>Gaul,</hi> where gathering an Army, he ſubdu'd all the Regions on this ſide the <hi>Cottian Alpes,</hi> and then accounted his poſſeſſion of the Empire ſecure; So as he drew his Son <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans</hi> out of his Monaſtical Solitude, and created him <hi>Caeſar:</hi> He placed the ſeat of his Empire at <hi>Arles,</hi> planted Guards upon the River <hi>Rhine,</hi> and broke the Forces ef the <hi>Vandals</hi> and other Nations, who had waſted thoſe Provinces: <hi>Conſtans</hi> prov'd ſucceſsful in <hi>Spain,</hi> and for his good ſucceſs there, was pronounc'd Emperour by his Father, to whom he repair'd, leaving <hi>Gerontius</hi> General in <hi>Spain;</hi> but the year following <hi>Conſtans</hi> was ſent back into <hi>Spain,</hi> attended by <hi>Juſtus</hi> a famous Captain; which ſo offended <hi>Gerontius,</hi> that he took ſides with the Barbarous Soldiers in <hi>Gaul,</hi> ſo as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> could not repreſs them; which caus'd both in <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Britain</hi> a Revolt from the <hi>Roman</hi> dependance; although ſome Authors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, <hi>That</hi> Honorius <hi>himſelf by his Letters exhorted the</hi> Britains <hi>to ſhift for themſelves: Gerontius</hi> hereupon aſſumes the Title of Emperour, and Inveſts <hi>Maximus,</hi> whom he left in <hi>Spain,</hi> with the ſame Purple: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he marcheth againſt <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> whom he Beſieg'd at <hi>Arles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Honorius</hi> ſent an Army into thoſe parts, upon the approach whereof, the Soldiers of <hi>Gerontius</hi> forſook him, and the remaining <hi>Spaniards</hi> attempt to kill him, ſetting the Houſe on fire in which he was; whereupon having firſt kill'd his Wife, he kills himſelf. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> afterwards having been Beſieg'd, and paſt hope of Relief, deveſts himſelf of the Imperial Purple, and flying for refuge to a Church, was there Conſecrated a Monk, and after ſlain with his Son <hi>Julian</hi> in his paſſage to <hi>Italy:</hi> A year before whoſe death, <hi>Rome</hi> was ſack'd by the <hi>Goths,</hi> and not only the Immenſe Wealth of that City, but the Ornaments of Churches alſo became a Prey to the Barbarous Soldiers.</p>
            <p>About this time mention is made of <hi>Melorus</hi> a young <hi>Britiſh</hi> Martyr: He was the Son of <hi>Metianus</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> diſpoſſeſs'd of his Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſlain by <hi>Rinaldus</hi> his Brother. <hi>Melorus</hi> at his Fathers Death was not above ſeven years old: The Cruel Uncle to ſecure himſelf in his unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96414:41"/>poſſeſſion, deſignes the death of the Child; a whole Synod of Biſhops there Aſſembled intercede for the Life of it, ſo as the Tyrant contented himſelf with the cutting off the Childs Right-hand and Left-foot; in place whereof were fram'd a Hand of Silver and Foot of Braſs. <hi>Melorus</hi> thus maim'd, was Educated in a Monaſtery of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> till he was fourteen years Old, ſpending his time in Reading Holy Scripture, and every day growing in Innocence, Virtue and Piety. <hi>Rinaldus</hi> at laſt by many Gifts and Promiſes, tempted the Childs <hi>Guardian</hi> to cut off his Head, which he ſent to <hi>Rinaldus;</hi> the Meſſenger who carried it, by the juſt judgement of God, fell from the Caſtle-Wall with the Head in his Hands, and broke his own Neck. It is ſaid, <hi>That the Childs Nurſe coming to the place where the Body lay, there ſhe ſaw a Viſion of Angels and Heavenly Lights ſhining with unſpeakable Brightneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Body was after Buried in a Decent place, but the day following found above ground; three ſeveral times it was Buried, and ſtill the ſame accident happ'ned: By common advice therefore the Body was laid upon a Cart, to which were faſtned too young Bulls never us'd to the yoak: Theſe were permitted to go at liberty without any Leader, whether Gods Providence ſhould direct them: The Bulls becoming Tame, carried the Body to a certain place, and then ſtood ſtill; but the Company attending the Cart not liking the place, as not fit for the Childs Burial, us'd all means by forcing the Wheels and otherwiſe, to drive the Cart further, but found it ſo fix'd by Divine Power, that it could be no means be mov'd, and therefore giving Thanks to God, buried the Sacred Body with great Solemnity in that place: And thither many Devout people repairing, and imploring the Martyrs help and interceſſion in their Afflictions and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, have frequently with Joy obtain'd their deſir'd remedy: The Head of the Martyr was carried as aforeſaid to <hi>Rinaldus,</hi> who handled the ſame, but died miſerably three days after; he being thus dead the Biſhops and Clergy carried the Head and Buried it with the Body. The Coffer wherein theſe Sacred Relicks lay, ſome time after were carried through ſeveral places to <hi>Ambrosbury,</hi> and their laid upon an Altar, where the Saint and his Relicks were in a ſpecial manner Venerated, as Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> affirms; <hi>This</hi> Ambrosbury <hi>is ſcituate in</hi> Wiltſhire, <hi>not far from</hi> Wincheſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Britain</hi> not forſaking its obedience to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, was now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by <hi>Victorinus,</hi> a man grateful to the <hi>Britains,</hi> but formidable to the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots;</hi> but he being too ſoon recall'd and the <hi>Roman</hi> Legion with him, the poor <hi>Britains</hi> became immediately expos'd to the Cruelty of their Barbarous Enemies. <hi>Bonifacius</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Zoſimus</hi> in the Apoſtolick Chair, who is ſaid by <hi>Proſper, To make uſe not only of Apoſtolick but of Imperial Edicts alſo, for the ſuppreſſing the</hi> Pelagians, <hi>the Affronters of Divine Grace.</hi> In the time of this <hi>Boniface,</hi> this Iſland was poiſon'd with their Preſumptuous Doctrines, eſpecially by <hi>Agricola</hi> the Son of a Biſhop: Yet were there then ſeveral Biſhops full of Piety and Learning, who oppos'd this <hi>Hereſie,</hi> the moſt Famous whereof, was <hi>Faſtidius Priſcus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>London,</hi> a man skilful in Holy Scriptures, and a zealous Preacher of Divine Truth, Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Holy Converſation, and Famous for his Sharpneſs of Judgement and Elocution; it is not certain when he dy'd, or when it was that <hi>Voadinus</hi> ſucceeded him in that Biſhoprick.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Britain</hi> was now infected with the Suggeſtions of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> ſo was it infeſted with the Incurſions of the <hi>Scots, Picts</hi> and <hi>Norwegians:</hi> In which

            </p>
            <p>They therefore again ſend Meſſengers in a deplorable manner, with rent Garment and Aſhes on their Heads, to implore Aide from the <hi>Romans;</hi> endeavouring like fearful Chickens to ſhrowd themſelves under their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wings: <hi>They earneſtly beg the reſcue of their miſerable Country, and the freeing the</hi> Roman <hi>Name from the contempt of Foraign Nations:</hi> This woeful Petition was addreſs'd to the Famous <hi>Roman</hi> General <hi>Aetius</hi> Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of <hi>Gaul,</hi> under whom <hi>Britain</hi> was alſo ſubject: He mov'd with Pity ſent Forces under the Conduct of <hi>Gallio</hi> a Citizen in <hi>Ravenna,</hi> who once more Conquer'd the Enemies; but having done this, declares the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours pleaſure to the <hi>Britains, That for the future they muſt rely upon their own ſtrength, and expect no more aſſiſtance from</hi> Rome; <hi>which at ſo great a diſtance, and amidſt ſo many Diſtractions, could not attend to ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a Province.</hi> He advis'd them to exerciſe themſelves in Military Affairs, to Build Fortifications in Convenient places, eſpecially towards the Sea, and to ſtrengthen their Cities with Walls. This was the laſt Farewel of the <hi>Romans</hi> to the diſcourag'd <hi>Britains;</hi> however, before they went, they joyn'd with the <hi>Britains</hi> in Repairing the Wall, which they made ſtronger than formerly, both by publick and Private Expences.</p>

            <p>Now ſince <hi>Patricius</hi> the great Apoſtle of <hi>Ireland,</hi> did both begin and end his days in <hi>Britain,</hi> it will be little or no Excurſion here to inſert ſome of his Principal Geſts: <hi>He Convers'd here in</hi> Brittain, <hi>by his Holy example inviting his Countrymen to the imitation of his Virtue and Piety.</hi> St. <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Lupus</hi> encourag'd him to go into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that eſpecially upon

            </p>
            <p>The labours both of <hi>Servanus</hi> and <hi>Tervanus</hi> were very proſperous; but <hi>Palladius</hi> is thought not to have liv'd above a year after he was made Biſhop. Soon after the firſt Voyage of <hi>Palladius</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> the People thereof being neither willing to receive that perverſe Doctrine which Blaſphem'd the Grace of Chriſt, nor able to refute the Subtilties of thoſe who maintain'd it; by common advice, crav'd aſſiſtance from the <hi>Gallican</hi> Biſhops, who in a Synod for that purpoſe aſſembled, made choice of St. <hi>Germanus</hi> and St. <hi>Lupus,</hi> one Biſhop of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> and the other of <hi>Troyes,</hi> to paſs over into <hi>Brittain,</hi> to confirm the Faith of Coeleſtial Grace. All which was done, as appears by <hi>Proſper,</hi> with the Conſent and by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>Pope Caeleſtine: Germanus</hi> was born at <hi>Auxerre,</hi> deſcended from Illuſtrious Parents, brought up in good Literature; wherein he ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd himſelf, that he became an Ornament to his Country; and that nothing might be wanting to the perfecting of his Learning; after he had frequented the <hi>Gallican</hi> Schools, where he was taught the Liberal Sciences, he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he inrich'd his Mind with the perfect knowledge of the Imperial Laws: At his return he was made Governour of the City and Territories of <hi>Auxerre</hi> the place of his Nativity.</p>
            <p>While he was Governour there, <hi>Amator</hi> the Biſhop of that City, a Holy man, preparing himſelf in the Church to perform his Office, and

From the firſt day in which he undertook the Epiſcopal Office, to the end of his Life, he never us'd Wine, Vinegar, Oyle, nor ſo much as Salt to give a Reliſh to his Meat: At his Refections, he firſt took Aſhes into his Mouth, and after that Barley-bread, and this ſo ſlender and ungrateful Diet, he never us'd till toward Sun-ſet ſometimes; and as is ſaid he would Faſt half a Week, yea ſeven whole days, without any ſatisfaction given to his craving Stomach; his Bed was hard Boards cover'd over with Aſhes, and to prevent any profound ſleep, he would admit no Pillow under his Head: He ſpent indeed whole nights in continual Sighing, and inceſſantly water'd his hard Couch with his Tears: He was a zealous obſerver of Hoſpitality, and when ever any poor, or Strangers, came to him, he would prepare for them a Plentiful Feaſt, while himſelf Faſted; yea with his own Hands he would waſh their Feet, Kiſſing and ſometimes Bedewing them with ſhowers of Tears. He built a Monaſtery, into which he oft retir'd feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and refreſhing his Mind there with the wonderful ſweetneſs of Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Contemplation.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Lupus</hi> was born at <hi>Toul,</hi> a City of the <hi>Leuci,</hi> of a Noble Family, after his Fathers death he was ſent to School, and there imbew'd in the ſtudy of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> he Married the Siſter of St. <hi>Hilarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles;</hi> ſhe was inflam'd with the Love of Chaſtity from her youth: Hence it was that after ſeven years ſpent in Marriage, by Divine Inſpiration both of them exhorted one another to a ſtate of Converſion; <hi>Lupus</hi> by a ſtrong impulſe from Heaven was mov'd to viſit the Bleſſed St. <hi>Honoratus,</hi> firſt Abbot of the Famous Monaſtery of <hi>Lerins,</hi> to whoſe Diſcipline he humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmitted himſelf in continual Watchings, Faſtings and Mortifications, and intending to Sell his Poſſeſſions, and diſtribute the Money to the Poor, he was on a ſuddain compell'd to take upon him the Biſhoprick of <hi>Troyes,</hi> where he behav'd himſelf ſo well, that he was ſtil'd the Father of Fathers, Biſhop of Biſhops, and a ſecond <hi>Jacob</hi> of his Age.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Holy men, under the conduct of our Lord, took upon them to be the Apoſtolick Reformers of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches, their Humility and Auſterity of Life, had a proper and ſpecifick Virtue to oppoſe the Pride and Senſuality of the <hi>Pelagian Hereticks.</hi> What befell them at Sea, would not be omitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At firſt their Ship was carried with favourable Winds from the</hi> Gallick <hi>Coaſts, 'till they came into the midſt of the Sea, where no Land could be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, but preſently after the fury of a whole Legion of Devils, envying their deſign for the Salvation of Souls, is ſaid to have aſſail'd them; dangers appear on every ſide, Storms are rais'd, Darkneſs covers the Heavens, and that Darkneſs becomes more terrible, by the fearful ſwelling of the Sea, and rage of the Air, no longer are the Sails able to ſuſtain the fury of the Winds,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96414:44"/>nor the Boat able to reſiſt the Mountains of Waters daſhing againſt it, ſo that the Ship was carried forward rather by their Prayers, than the skill or force of the Mariners: The prime Pilot St.</hi> Germanus <hi>was then ſecurely compos'd in ſleep, and the Ship ready to ſink, ſo that St.</hi> Lupus <hi>and the Company were fain to awake the Old man; who was only able to withſtand the fury of the enrag'd Elements. He not at all aſtoniſh'd at the danger, Addreſses his Prayers to our Lord, and his Threats to the unruly Ocean; To the raging ſtorm he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the cauſe of Religion, which invited them to that Voyage; and preſently with a little quantity of Oyl, which he Bleſſed in the Name of the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and then ſprinkled upon the Waves, he overcame their fury: His Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue he admoniſh'd, the reſt he encourag'd, ſo that with one breath and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour Prayers were pour'd forth to our Lord, and immediately the Divine Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſhew'd it ſelf preſent, the Infernal Enemies were diſſipated, a calm tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity enſu'd, the Windes and Waves became ſerviceable to the Voyage, and all things concurr'd to their ſafe Arrival in a quiet and ſecure Haven:</hi> Several examples of the like effects, wrought by common Oyl, Bleſſed in this manner, may be found in ſeveral Authors.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Holy men being Landed, great multitudes from ſeveral quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters met to receive them, having as is ſaid, been inform'd of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the Predictions of Wicked Spirits, who were afrighted thereat, and declar'd openly their tampering by Tempeſts and otherwiſe, to hinder the Paſſage of theſe Holy Men; and that by their Power and Sanctity, they had at laſt been vanquiſh'd and diſappointed: Theſe Venerable Biſhops ſoon fill'd the whole Iſland with their Fame, Preaching and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; they were ſo over-preſs'd with multitudes reſorting to them, that they Preach'd Gods Word, not only in Churches, but in Lanes and High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, whereby <hi>Catholicks</hi> were confirm'd in the Faith, and thoſe who had been deprav'd reduc'd to the Church: The Authority of their Holyneſs, the Eminence of their Learning, the wonder of their Miracles, gave them the eſteem and Honour of Apoſtles, and reduc'd the whole Iſland to the acknowledgement of their Doctrine: The promoters of the contrary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, crept into dark Holes, vex'd as the wicked Spirits were, to ſee the People freed from their Snares: Yet at laſt after long ſtudy and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they preſum'd to enter into a Diſpute with theſe Apoſtolick men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pelagians</hi> are ſaid to come Pompouſly attended by their flattering Diſciples, and rather choſe to run the hazard of a conflict, than by their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence confeſs they had an ill Cauſe: Infinite numbers were aſſembled, with their Wives and Children, to hear this Diſpute: The Diſputants ſtood on each ſide, of much different condition; on the one ſide was placed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority, on the other Humane preſumption, here Orthodox Faith, there Perfidious Errour; here <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Author, there <hi>Pelagius:</hi> The Holy Biſhops gave free ſcope of diſputing to the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who vainly ſpent the time, and tyr'd the Auditory with empty Verbal Diſcourſes: But after them the Venerable Biſhops poured forth the torrent of their Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, accompanied with Evangelical thunder, with their own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, Texts of Divine Scripture, the word of God giving witneſs to their Aſſertions: And thus vanity became convinc'd, and Perfidiouſneſs confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; ſo as the <hi>Hereticks</hi> by their inability to reply, acknowledg'd their guilt; and the People ſtanding by as Judges, could ſcarce contain their Hands from violence towards them, and with Clamours reſounded the Victory.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:96414:44"/>
            <p>Immediately a Tribune of the Army with his Wife, leading in their hands their young Daughter about ten years Old, being Blind, came into the midſt of the Aſſembly, and preſented their blind Child to the Biſhops, deſiring their help for her Cure: They had formerly offer'd her in vain to the adverſe Party; who likewiſe ſtricken with a guilty Conſcience, joyn with the Parents in their entreaties to the Holy Prelates in behalf of the Child: They perceiving the expectation of the People, and the Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Adverſaries, addreſs themſelves to God by ſhort Prayer: Then St. <hi>Germanus</hi> full of the Holy Ghoſt, invok'd the Bleſſed Trinity, and taking from his Neck a little Box full of Holy Relicks, in the ſight of the whole Multitude, he apply'd it to the Eyes of the young Maid, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately looſing their former Darkneſs, were fill'd with a new Light from Heaven: At this ſo apparent Miracle the Parents rejoyce, and the People tremble: After this day all mens minds were ſo clearly purg'd from this impious <hi>Hereſie,</hi> that with thirſting deſire they receiv'd the Doctrine of theſe Holy Biſhops.</p>
            <p>Perverſe <hi>Hereſie</hi> thus repell'd, and the Authors of it confuted; the Holy Biſhops repair'd to the Sepulchre of St. <hi>Albanus,</hi> intending to give Thanks to God by his interceſſion, and having with them Relicks of all the Apoſtles and divers Martyrs; after Prayer made, commanded the Sepulchre to be open'd, and there with great Reverence laid up thoſe precious Gifts; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it convenient that the ſame Repoſitory ſhould contain the Members of many Saints, out of divers Regions, whom Heaven had receiv'd and Crown'd for the equality of their Merits: St. <hi>German</hi> then caus'd to be dig'd up from the place where the Bleſſed Martyr St. <hi>Alban</hi> had ſhed his Blood, a Maſſe of dry'd Earth, which he intended to take with him; in which were then extant Marks of the Martyrs death, and the Paleneſs of his Perſecutors: Theſe things being thus perform'd, an innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, is ſaid to be that day Converted to our Lord: The little Box of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Relicks, it is reported, after St. <hi>Germans</hi> death, came to the Hands of the Empreſs <hi>(Galla Placidia)</hi> as Heir only of his Benediction.</p>
            <p>The malicious Enemy of mankind, buſie to entrap the Holy Biſhop St. <hi>German</hi> in ſome miſchief, found out the means by a caſual Fall, to put his Foot out of Joynt: Now while by reaſon of this Infirmity he was conſtrain'd to abide in a certain Lodging, a Fire happen'd to break out in ſome Houſes not far from it, which being cover'd with Thatch, were quickly devour'd, and the Fire driven forward by Wind, ſoon approach'd to his Lodging, whereupon a great concourſe of People came to the Venerable Biſhop in a great fright, intending to take him in their Arms, and carry him out of danger; but he reprehended them, and refus'd to remove, having a firm Faith that no evil ſhould happen to him: The multitude then deſpairing of his Safety, endeavour to ſtop the Progreſs of the flames: Howbeit Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to exalt his own Power, and his Servants Faith, ſo order'd that whatever the People endeavour'd to preſerve was conſum'd, only the place where the ſick Saint lay was preſerv'd, for the flames, as if afraid to touch him, flew quite over his lodging; though on each ſide of it, they rag'd with violence, but left it untouch'd: The multitude ſeeing this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyc'd, and were well pleas'd that their Labours and Endeavours had been over-maſter'd by Divine Power.</p>
            <p>Whilſt this Holy man lay there, he was watch'd and attended by a numberleſs multitude, ſome ſeeking Health for their Souls, ſome for there
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96414:45"/>Bodies: The wonderful Miracles which our Lord wrought by his Servant, were ſo many, they can ſcarce be re-counted; he being infirm himſelf, gave Health and Strength to others, neither would he ſuffer any remedy to be apply'd to his Infirmity; but on a certain night, he ſaw a perſon ſtanding before him in White Garments, who ſtretching forth his Hand, ſeem'd to raiſe him up from his Couch, commanding him to ſtand firmly; after which his pain paſs'd away, and his ſtrength was ſo reſtor'd, that the day following he confidently undertook to purſue his journey.</p>
            <p>At this time the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> with joynt Forces made War upon the <hi>Britains,</hi> who were therefore drawn together in a Body; but being diſtruſtful of their Ability to reſiſt ſuch Powerful Enemies, they humbly implore the aſſiſtance of theſe Godly Biſhops, which they chearfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, and haſtening into the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Army, ſo encreas'd the Courage and Reſolution of the <hi>Britains,</hi> as if a new Army had been joyn'd unto them; ſo as our Lord himſelf by the Miniſtery of theſe his Captains, ſeem'd to be General of the Army: It was now the Holy time of <hi>Lent,</hi> which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of theſe Holy Biſhops caus'd to be obſerv'd with the greater Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their daily Preaching invited many to partake of the Sacrament of Baptiſm. A Church was thereupon prepar'd againſt the Solemnity of <hi>Eaſter;</hi> and though the place was no other then open Fields, yet it was ordered, as if it had been in a City: The Army went in Proceſſion, moiſten'd with the waters of Baptiſm, and being inſlam'd with the fervour of Holy Faith, they contemn'd the Guard of outward Weapons, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a more ſure Protection from Heaven.</p>
            <p>This Poſture of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Army came to the Enemies knowledge, who not doubting of Victory againſt Unarm'd People, with great chearfulneſs haſt'ned to ſet upon them: The <hi>Britains</hi> had notice of their march, and as ſoon as the Solemn Feaſt of our Lords Reſurrection was paſt, the greater part of the Army being newly Baptiz'd, betook themſelves to theirs Arms, and prepar'd for Battle: St. <hi>German</hi> being their General, he made choice of a Band of Light Arm'd men, and takes a view of the Country round about, obſerving alſo a Valley compaſs'd with Mountains directly in the Enemies way, he leads part of the Army into that Valley. The fierce Enemies approaching, and being diſcover'd by thoſe who lay in Ambuſh; St. <hi>German</hi> their Leader gave order to all his Soldiers, <hi>That with loud cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour they ſhould repeat the words by him pronounc'd;</hi> And immediately while the Enemies thought to fall on, preſuming they had not been diſcover'd; the Holy Biſhop three times cry'd out aloud <hi>Allelujah,</hi> whereupon the reſt of the Army with one voice Thundred out likewiſe <hi>Allelujah,</hi> the noiſe whereof was Terrible, multiply'd and increas'd by the Eccho from the Mountains round about.</p>
            <p>The ſound alone of this Sacred Word, ſuffic'd to terrify the Enemies Army, which fell a trembling, as if not the Rocks only, but Heaven it ſelf had fallen on their Heads, inſomuch as they all betook themſelves to a general flight in all haſte, caſting away their Weapons, and glad to eſcape with their Naked Bodies: Great numbers of them in their Head-long flight were ſwallow'd up by a River, through which a little before they had march'd with confidence and leaſure enough: The main body of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Army without ſtriking one ſtroak, was a chearful Spectator of the Vengeance of Almighty God, to whom only they gave the Glory of the Victory.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:96414:45"/>
            <p>The Holy Biſhops indeed Triumph'd, to ſee the Enemies defeated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Blood-ſhed; they Triumph'd for a Victory obtain'd, not by Arms, but Faith only: And having thus every way ſettled this Rich Iſland in Security, both from the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> they prepar'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their return, to the great Grief of the whole Nation. The place of this unbloody Battle, is ſaid to be a Town call'd <hi>Mold</hi> in <hi>Flint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> where is a Field call'd from St. <hi>German,</hi> in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Tongue <hi>Maesgarmon;</hi> there is alſo the little River <hi>Alen</hi> which runs hard by, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in probably the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> were drown'd; beſides, the place being near the Sea, it lay fit to ſet on board the <hi>Saxon</hi> Armies; St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the great in expounding the words of <hi>Job,</hi> makes mention of this <hi>Allelujah</hi> reſounded thus by the <hi>Britains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bleſſings conferr'd on this Iſland, were in ſome degree recompens'd by their ſafe and proſperous return, which they are ſaid to have aſcrib'd to the Interceſſion of our Tutelar Saint and Protomartyr <hi>Alban:</hi> Their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from home and reſidence here in <hi>Britain,</hi> was little more than the ſpace of a year, in which time many wonderful things were wrought by them; during the time that St. <hi>Germanus</hi> remain'd in <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Patrick</hi> then 68 years of Age, inſeparably adher'd to him, having learn'd from him many inſtructions in Chriſtian Doctrine and Diſcipline, and receiv'd many examples of Virtue and Piety for imitation: By him likewiſe he was encourag'd to undertake the Converſion of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, but with all admoniſh'd, <hi>To expect a Commiſſion from the See of</hi> Rome <hi>to execute that Apoſtolick Office.</hi> For which purpoſe he accompanied St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus</hi> to <hi>Gaul,</hi> from whence the next year he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to have his Journey into <hi>Ireland</hi> confirm'd by Authority from <hi>Pope Caeleſtinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Patrick</hi> took with him a Prieſt nam'd <hi>Sergetius,</hi> a Devout Servant of our Lord, as a Companion in his Travels; when he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> he committed himſelf to the Praebends of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to be the more perfectly inſtructed in their Inſtitutes: He repair'd alſo to the Holy <hi>Pope Caeleſtinus,</hi> and humbly caſting himſelf at his feet, beſought him, <hi>To em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his care for the Converſion of the</hi> Pagan Iriſh <hi>Nation;</hi> The Petition was very acceptable to the <hi>Pope,</hi> who chang'd this Holy mans Name, from <hi>Magonius</hi> to <hi>Patricius,</hi> as Prophecying, <hi>That he ſhould be the Father of many Souls:</hi> His Name thus chang'd, he was promoted to Epiſcopal Dignity, and then directed to his Voyage into <hi>Ireland:</hi> St. <hi>Patrick</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in one of his Epiſtles, tranſcrib'd out of a Copy in the Abby of <hi>Glaſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> which Epiſtle is mention'd here before, makes all this clear: Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Epiſcopal degree, the <hi>Pope</hi> beſtow'd on St. <hi>Patrick</hi> 12 years Indulgence.</p>
            <p>He was accompanied in his Legation with 20 Eminent Perſons for his aſſiſtance, one of which was <hi>Sergetius</hi> before mention'd: He diverted in his return to his Inſtructor St. <hi>Germanus,</hi> from whoſe Liberality he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd <hi>Chalices, Prieſtly Veſtments and ſtore of Books,</hi> with many other things proper for his Miniſtery. Long before St. <hi>Patrick</hi> came into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by the <hi>Magicians</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> Prophets there, intimation was given of his coming; their Prophcy was to this effect, <hi>That a man would come thither with his Wood, whoſe Table ſhould be placed in the Eaſtern ſide of his Houſe, and ſome perſons ſtanding behind, together with others from the Table, will Sing, and the Congregation will Anſwer them, ſaying, AMEN. When
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96414:46"/>this man comes, he will deſtroy our Gods, ſubvert our Temples, deſtroy Princes which reſiſt him, and his Doctrine ſhall remain and prevail here for ever.</hi> With ſuch words theſe blind Prophets incens'd both the Prince and People againſt St. <hi>Patricius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They compos'd a certain Rhyme, importing, <hi>That a Head of Art and Skill, with his Crooked Staff would come, from that hour every Houſe ſhall be bor'd through the Top: He will chant an abomination from his Table at the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the Houſe; and his whole Family will anſwer,</hi> So be it, So be it. The meaning of this dark Rhyme is, <hi>That the Maſter of Wiſdom would come with the Sign of the Croſs, by which the hearts of all men would feel Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction, and from the Altar of the Holy Myſteries he would Convert Souls unto Chriſt, ſo as all Chriſtian People ſhould Anſwer,</hi> Amen. <hi>And then our</hi> Pagan <hi>Kingdom ſhall fall;</hi> as in truth it afterwards did: This piece of Wood is by moſt taken for the <hi>Croſs,</hi> others affirm it to ſignifie, <hi>A certain wonderful Staff which St.</hi> Patrick <hi>before his Journey receiv'd from a Holy Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and was call'd the Staff of Jeſus.</hi> The Author of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Life, relates the Story of the Staff to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That St.</hi> Patrick <hi>by Divine Revelation paſs'd over to a certain Solitary</hi> Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, <hi>living in an Iſland of the</hi> Tyrrhen <hi>Sea, whoſe Name was</hi> Juſtus, <hi>a man of a Holy Life and great Fame; this man of God gave to St.</hi> Patrick <hi>the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Staff, affirming ſeriouſly, That he had receiv'd it immediately from the Hand of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who had appear'd to him. There were other men in the ſame Iſland at ſome aiſtance, who alſo led Solitary Lives: Some of theſe St.</hi> Patrick <hi>obſerv'd to be very Freſh and Youthfull, others very Decrepid and Old, were the Children of them who appear'd ſo Youthful; at which the Saint being aſtoniſh'd, and enquiring the occaſion of ſo great a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, was thus Anſwer'd,</hi> We from our Childhood, by Divine Grace, have been much addicted to Works of Mercy, our doors ſtood ever open to Travellers, demanding Meat or Lodging: On a certain night it happen'd, that a Stranger with a Staff in his Hand was Entertain'd by us, and us'd with all the Courteſie we could; the morning he gave us his Benediction, telling us he was Jeſus Chriſt, and ſaying to us, <hi>You have oft hitherto mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto my Members, and this night Entertain'd me in my own Perſon;</hi> this ſaid, He gave the Staff in his Hand to a man of God, our Father both Spiritually and Carnally, commanding him to keep it, <hi>Till in ſucceeding times a ſtranger Nam'd</hi> Patrick <hi>ſhould come to viſit him, and then to give it to that Stranger;</hi> and having ſaid this, he aſcended up into Heaven. <hi>From that day, thoſe</hi> Hermits <hi>told St.</hi> Patrick, <hi>They had remain'd in the ſame ſtate of Youthful Comlineſs and Vigour; whereas their Children, who were then little Infants, were, as he ſaw, become decrepid Old men.</hi> This Story of St. <hi>Patrick</hi> and his Staff, is reported by <hi>Jocelinus</hi> Author of his Life. Now what Credit ſoever this Story may find in the minds of the Readers, certain it is, that a Staff believ'd to have belong'd to St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> and nam'd the Staff of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> was for many Ages in great Veneration among the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> And St. <hi>Bernard</hi> in the Life of St. <hi>Malachias</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Biſhop, mentions and deſcribes this Staff, and the great eſteem it had in that Nation; and if we will believe <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis, It was the Vulgar Opinion, that with this Staff,</hi> St. Patrick <hi>caſt out of the Iſland all Venomous Beaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſeems to have enter'd into <hi>Ireland</hi> in the year 432. as Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> computes. The Inhabitants of the Country having advice of his Landing, flock'd to him from all Parts, eſpecially the common People came joyfully
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96414:46"/>to him, as if he had been of their own Nation: He had indeed many Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which invited their good Will towards him: He was of a Comely Perſonage, very Civil in Converſation, and though extreamly Grave, yet without Moroſity: Beſides this, he ſpoke <hi>Iriſh</hi> perfectly, and from his Youth had inform'd himſelf of their Natural Diſpoſitions, ſo as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently became one of them: But God was the principal cauſe of conciliat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Affections to him, and by his ſpecial Grace great multitudes in a ſhort time yielded their Aſſent and Obedience to his Chriſtian Doctrine.</p>
            <p>For St. <hi>Patrick</hi> like a good Shepherd, carefully watch'd over his new flock, informing them daily in all Duties of Piety, convincing the <hi>Pagans</hi> of their Errors, and confounding the <hi>Magicians</hi> which oppos'd him. The Converſion of one <hi>Iriſh</hi>-man is ſpecially taken notice of, whoſe Name was <hi>Dicon,</hi> whom St. <hi>Patrick</hi> gain'd, as he was paſſing through his Land, to ſubmit to the Doctrine of our Lord; and of a Wolf in a wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner chang'd him into a Lamb; <hi>For</hi> Dicon <hi>coming ſuddainly with Weapons, intended to have kill'd</hi> St. Patrick <hi>and his Companions; but as ſoon as he ſaw his face, he was prick'd in his Heart; our Lord immediately turning his Thoughts, ſo as he meekly led him to his Houſe, where the Holy Biſhop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided ſometime, Preaching to him the Faith of Chriſt ſo effectually, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the firſt of all the Iſland, who believ'd with all his Family.</hi>

            <p>In thoſe days the <hi>Scots</hi> grievouſly vex'd <hi>Britain,</hi> ſo that his Father un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuſtain the weight and troubles of Government, would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd the Province to <hi>Carantac;</hi> but he loving the Caeleſtial King, more than an Earthly Kingdom, fled away; and having bought a Wallet and Staff of a poor man, by Gods Conduct was brought to a Pleaſant place, where he repoſing himſelf built an Oratory, and ſpent his time in the Praiſes of God: At laſt he paſs'd over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> invited by his Affection to St. <hi>Patrick;</hi> when he came thither it was agreed between them, that one of them ſhould travel Preaching the Goſpel toward the Right Hand, and the other towards the Left: In their company many Eccleſiaſtical perſons attended them, and they all agreed to meet once a year at an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place: Where ever this Holy man <hi>Carantac</hi> went, an Angel of our Lord in the likeneſs of a Dove accompanied him, and chang'd his

The grace at firſt given to the Apoſtles, is ſaid to have been plentifully beſtow'd on him; He was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an admirable Soldier and Champion of Chriſt, a Spiritual and Devout Abbot, refuſing to Preach Saving Truth unto none: He ſpent many years in that Iſland, where he brought an incredible number to waſh away their ſins by Pennance, by day and night offering innumerable Prayers to God; and having Converted many People to our Lord, who wrought many Miracles by him; He at laſt return'd to his Native Country, where he retir'd to his former Cave, accompanied with many Diſciples: There having built a Church, he determin'd to abide; but not long after being admoniſh'd by a Voice from Heaven, he return'd into <hi>Ireland;</hi> where, in a good Old Age, and full of good Works, he reſted in Peace, and was buried in his own City, from him call'd <hi>Cherach.</hi>

            <p>I ſhall here add the Geſts of another <hi>Britiſh</hi> Saint, and Companion of St. <hi>Patrick</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> call'd <hi>Luman,</hi> Son of <hi>Gollitus</hi> a <hi>Brittain,</hi> and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to St. <hi>Patrick</hi> by his Siſter <hi>Tigridia:</hi> He was the Founder of the Church of <hi>Trim</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> the occaſion and manner whereof is thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher. St.</hi> Luman <hi>came to the Ford of</hi> Truim, <hi>which runs before the Caſtle of</hi> Fiedilmed <hi>Son of</hi> Loiguor: <hi>And early in the morning</hi> Froitchern <hi>Son of</hi> Fiedilmed, <hi>found him Preaching the Goſpel of Chriſt, who wondering at the Doctrine taught by him, preſently believ'd, and was Baptiz'd in Chriſt by</hi> Luman, <hi>at a Fountain ariſing in the ſame place, and ſtay'd with him until his Mother who ſought after him came to the ſame place: She was over-joy'd at the ſight of the Holy man, becauſe ſhe alſo came out of</hi> Britain, <hi>and being inſtructed by him likewiſe believ'd; and returning Home, told her Husband what had hapned to her ſelf and her Son:</hi> Fiedelmed <hi>was much joy'd at the arrival of</hi> Luman, <hi>becauſe his Mother call'd</hi> Schotnoeſa, <hi>had been the Daughter of a</hi> Britiſh <hi>Prince.</hi> Fiedilmed <hi>therefore went to him, and Saluted him in the</hi> Britiſh <hi>Language, queſtioning him in particular touching his Deſcent and Doctrine, who anſwer'd, That his Name was</hi> Luman <hi>a</hi> Brittain, <hi>a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and Diſciple of the Holy Biſhop S.</hi> Patrick, <hi>ſent, as he ſaid, by God to Convert the Inhabitants of that Country to the Faith of Chriſt, and Baptize them;</hi> Fiedilmed <hi>immediately believ'd with his whole Family, and offer'd him and St.</hi> Patrick <hi>his whole Territory with his Son.</hi> Fiedilmed <hi>remov'd his Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation beyond the River</hi> Boindeo, <hi>but</hi> Luman with Froitchern, <hi>ſtay'd at the Ford of</hi> Truim, <hi>'till St.</hi> Patrick <hi>came thither, where they joyntly erected a Church, about</hi> 12 <hi>years, before the Church of</hi> Armagh (Attimachae) <hi>was founded; the beginning of which Arch-Epiſcopal Church, the Annals of</hi> Ulſter <hi>aſcribe to the year of Grace</hi> 444.</p>
            <p>We may now not unfitly treat of St. <hi>Benignus,</hi> as his Story may be found in the Antiquities of <hi>Glaſtonbury, The Venerable Biſhop St.</hi> Patrick <hi>Preaching the Goſpel through the Provinces of</hi> Ireland, <hi>came to a plain call'd</hi> Brey <hi>or</hi> Breg <hi>very Spacious and Beautiful, with which being delighted, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd there to Celebrate the Feaſt of</hi> Eaſter, <hi>then at hand: His firſt Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Familiarity in that Province, was with a man whom he had newly Converted to the Faith, with him St.</hi> Patrick <hi>Lodg'd: This man had a Young Child call'd</hi> Beonna, <hi>who bore a tender Affection to the Saint, he would often play with him, and Kiſs his Foot; the Child would not ſleep, but when he lay with the Holy Biſhop: He therefore Prophetically perceiving the great Grace, which the Divine Bounty would confer upon the Child, vouchſafed to take him
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96414:47"/>to his Bed, and gave him the Name of</hi> Benignus. <hi>When the Holy Biſhop was ready to proceed in his Journey, the Child with Pittiful cries, beg'd to go along with him, ſo as the Biſhop was forc'd to receive him into his Waggon, and Prophecy'd, that he ſhould be his Succeſſor in the Biſhoprick, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly came to paſs.</hi> This was the firſt Solemnity of <hi>Eaſter</hi> which the Holy Biſhop Celebrated in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and he did it by imitating the Son of God, who at his laſt Supper with his Diſciples, Conſecrated his Body and Blood for the Redemption of Mankind: The day before this great Feaſt of our Lords Reſurrection, St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> according to an Eccleſiaſtical Rite, as <hi>Probus</hi> obſerves then in uſe, <hi>Kindled the Holy fire, the Flame whereof ſhone brightly about the place.</hi> According to the cuſtom of that Country, it was, it ſeems, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful for any to Light a Fire, before it was kindled in the Kings Palace:</hi> The King whoſe Name was <hi>Logorius,</hi> perceiving the brightneſs of the Flame, in great indignation threatn'd Death to him who had infring'd that cuſtom in his Kingdom: His <hi>Magicians</hi> about him, to incenſe him further, told the King, <hi>That the Fire which had ſo been kindled againſt Law, unleſs preſently extinguiſh'd, would never ceaſe to the Worlds end, but obſcure all the Fires which they kindled according to their cuſtom; and that the man who lighted it, would be the deſtruction of his Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While St. <hi>Patrick</hi> with great ſucceſs thus labour'd in the Goſpel, <hi>Britain</hi> was Illuſtrated with the Memory of another great St. <hi>Winwaloc,</hi> the Son of a Noble Perſon, call'd <hi>Fracan,</hi> Couſin-German of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Prince Nam'd <hi>Coton.</hi> This St. <hi>Winwaloc</hi> is ſaid to have been from his Childhood inflam'd with an earneſt deſire of Heavenly things, to deſpiſe Worldly Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to live to God only; wherefore he beſought his Parents, that he might be commended to the care of a certain Religious man, to be by him imbew'd in the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures and Documents of Piety, his requeſt being obtain'd, he made wonderful progreſs in Virtue and Holineſs under that Religious mans Diſcipline; inſomuch, that when he was but ſeven years Old, he became an example of all Piety and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: In proceſs of time having undertaken a Monaſtical Profeſſion, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Graces ſhone more brightly in him, ſo as he became withall enrich'd with the Gift of Prophecy. Many Miracles God wrought by him, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof; having a firm Faith, he made uſe only of the Sign of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and Oyl which had been Bleſſed: Among which Miracles, the moſt ſtupendious was, <hi>His raiſing a Young man to Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time the Glory of the moſt Holy Prelate St. <hi>Patrick</hi> was famous in Gods Church, who like a bright Star Illuſtrated all <hi>Ireland;</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his admirable Virtues, kindled in St. <hi>Winwaloc</hi> ſo great an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards him, that he endeavour'd to paſs over to him, and be ſubject to his direction in Piety. Behold, while the Holy mans thoughts were buſied about this deſign; St. <hi>Patrick</hi> in a Viſion preſented himſelf to him, with an Angelical Brightneſs, and a Golden Diadem on his Head, telling him, <hi>He was the ſame</hi> Patrick <hi>whom he ſo earneſtly deſir'd to Viſit: But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to prevent a dangerous Journey by Sea and Land, our Lord hath ſent me to thee, to fulfil thy deſire, ſo as thou mayſt enjoy both my Sight and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation:</hi> He further told St. <hi>Winwaloc, That he ſhould be a Guide and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of many in Spiritual Warfare: for which end he gave him many whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Inſtructions: Exhorting him to deſire from his Maſter ſome Companions, and with them to remove to another place.</hi> No ſooner was this Viſion va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, but St. <hi>Winwaloc</hi> went to the Cell wherein the Father of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96414:48"/>was, attending on Divine Meditation, to whom St. <hi>Winwaloc</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd the Viſion; whereupon the Father told him with a joyful Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>That he had been Honour'd with a Divine Viſitation and Revelation,</hi> and forthwith he aſſign'd the Saint eleven Diſciples, ſuch as were moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in Gods Service: With theſe he paſs'd over into a certain Iſland, and for the ſpace of three years, there led an <hi>Hermetical</hi> Life; but the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expos'd to Violent Tempeſts, and incommodious for its Barrenneſs, St. <hi>Winwaloc</hi> Pray'd God to direct him to a more Convenient Habitation, God heard his Prayers, and ſhew'd him a place near the Sea, but there being no Ship ready, the Saint is ſaid to have renew'd his Prayers; which done, <hi>He bad his Companions be Couragious and firm in Faith,</hi> ſaying to them, <hi>As you ſee me lead this Brother by the Hand, ſo do every one of you take his next Fellows Hand and follow one another:</hi> Then invoking the Name of our Lord, with his Paſtoral Staff he ſtruck the Sea, upon which it pleas'd God to repeat the Miracle of the <hi>Red-Sea, For the Sea open'd a Paſſage for them; ſo that taking one another by the Hand, and himſelf marching in the Front, they all walk'd ſecurely over the dry Sands, the Waters on both ſides ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like Walls; and as they paſs'd thus, they ſang to our Lord a Hymn of Praiſe and Joyfulneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid this Saint from the 20th. year of his Age to his Death, was never ſeen to ſit in the Church; never exceeded Moderation in any thing, never was dejected with Sadneſs, nor diſſolv'd in Mirth; never Angry or Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent, but Kind and Affable to all: He repeated the Pſalms every day; ſometimes ſtanding with his Arms ſtretch'd out in figure of a <hi>Croſs,</hi> and ſometimes falling on his Knees: From the time that he began to build his Habitation, he never us'd any Woollen or Linnen Garment, but what was made of Goat Skins only: In his Bed he neither had Feathers or Cloaths; inſtead of Feathers, he ſtrew'd under him Nut-ſhells; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Blankets, he cover'd himſelf with Sand mingled with Pebbles; two great Stones were his Pillows; day and night he wore the ſame Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Wheaten Bread he never Eat; a ſmall proportion of Barley Bread contented him, wherewith was mingled an equal meaſure of Aſhes: He took his Refection once only in two, ſometimes in three days; his other Diet was a mixture of Meal and Cabbage without any Fat; upon <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> and <hi>Sundays,</hi> he would add a little Cheeſe Sodd in water; and at <hi>Eaſter</hi> a few ſmall Fiſhes: It was his uſual cuſtom dayly to viſit a Church about a Mile diſtant from his Monaſteries, attended by a Deacon nam'd <hi>Egbin,</hi> and there to offer Sacrifices to God for the Living and Dead: Such was his diligence and Devotion at the Holy Altar, that he is ſaid to have there merited the reward of everlaſting Happineſs.</p>
            <p>One day an Angel is ſaid to have appear'd unto him, ſaying, <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Father, the Heavenly Citizens deſire thee for their Companion, and ſoon ſhalt thou be deliver'd from thy painful Exerciſes.</hi> After this he preſently call'd his Brethren together, and bad them prepare, <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as ſoon as I have Sung</hi> Maſs, <hi>and Communicated the Body and Blood of our Lord, at the ſixth hour of the day, our Lord will receive me out of this Mortal Body:</hi> And ſo having Celebrated <hi>Maſs,</hi> as he ſtood at the Altar between two <hi>Monks</hi> which ſuſtain'd him on each ſide, and was Singing with his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, he render'd his Soul to God, as untouch'd by Corporal Sickneſs, as it was free from any Carnal ſtains. Some ſay his Body was tranſlated from his Monaſtery at <hi>Tauriacum,</hi> and laid in the <hi>Blandin</hi> Monaſtery at
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96414:48"/>
               <hi>Gaunt:</hi> Others contend that his Sacred Relicks repoſe at <hi>Monſtrueil,</hi> where they likewiſe ſhew his <hi>Chaſuble, Alb,</hi> and <hi>Stole;</hi> and there is a Church Dedicated to his memory, in <hi>French</hi> call'd St. <hi>Waley:</hi> Now though St. <hi>Winwaloc</hi> died out of <hi>Britain,</hi> yet there are not there wanting Monuments of his Memory and Sanctity; a Town there is in <hi>Shropſhire</hi> call'd after his Name, <hi>Wenlock,</hi> and ſo was nam'd in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, where the Holy Virgin <hi>Milburga</hi> founded a Monaſtery for Religious Virgins, as may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be declar'd.</p>
            <p>The foremention'd Deacon <hi>Egbin</hi> or <hi>Ethbin,</hi> is alſo renown'd for his Sanctity, he over-liv'd his Maſter, and went over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where, in a Wood call'd <hi>Neeten</hi> he built a Monaſtery in which he liv'd and dy'd: He was as is above-noted, choſen by St. <hi>Winwalock</hi> to attend him daily to the little Church before-mention'd. <hi>Going one day thither together, one met them vail'd in the Figure of a miſerable Leaper, with a lamentable voice beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their aſſiſtance;</hi> Ethbin <hi>with great Compaſſion and Charity Embrac'd and Kiſs'd the Leaper, the ſame alſo at his monition did St.</hi> Winwaloc: <hi>Our Lord accepted their Office of Charity with great Kindneſs, for he delights to be cheriſh'd in his poor Members; therefore he was pleas'd to give each of them a preſent reward of their unfain'd Charity; for flying from their Embraces, our Lord immediately in a Cloud with great Glory, and with Gracious words aſſur'd them, that their Names were already written in the Book of Life, and that with his Saints they ſhould be partakers of his Kingdom.</hi> This moſt Happy aſſurance <hi>Ethbin</hi> aſcrib'd to the Merits of St. <hi>Winwaloc,</hi> eſteeming vilely of himſelf; and on the other ſide St. <hi>Winwaloc,</hi> mov'd with the ſame Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Charity, caſt the Merit on <hi>Ethbin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This year 432. is remarkable for the Happy Death of St. <hi>Ninianus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mention'd: This Holy man wonderful for Miracles, and Illuſtrious for many Virtues, at laſt approach'd to the Happy day, in which God Graciouſly call'd him out of this Mortal Life: So as being perfect in Grace and Piety, and mature in Age, he Happily mounted to Heaven; his Body was buried in the Church Dedicated to St. <hi>Martin,</hi> built by himſelf from the Foundation: The <hi>Centuriatours</hi> add this to his Story, <hi>That he was a</hi> Venedocian, <hi>Teacher of Chriſtian Verities, of a deſert more than ordinary; To his Old Age he largely communicated the Talent, wherewith God had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted him, among the</hi> Britains, Scots <hi>and</hi> Southern Picts. <hi>He was a man Aſſiduous in Reading the Holy Scripture, Merciful to Orphans, Widdows and the Poor; Illuſtrious in Miracles and Sanctity: By his Pious Induſtry the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the</hi> Picts, <hi>firſt of all relinquiſhing their Idolatry, embrac'd the true Faith of Chriſt: He was the firſt Biſhop of</hi> Candida Caſa, <hi>and dy'd among the</hi> Picts <hi>in the Province of</hi> Galloway.</p>
            <p>I may further obſerve, that he was very Devout in giving Reſpect and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to Gods Saints, in whoſe Honour he built Churches, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to the Honour of S. <hi>Martin,</hi> who dy'd about 30 years before him: The example of St. <hi>Ninian,</hi> was imitated by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church near the ſame Age; for when St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk came into <hi>Britain</hi> to Convert the <hi>Saxons, He found</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Bede</hi>) <hi>in the City of</hi> Canterbury <hi>a Church Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Honour of St.</hi> Martin, <hi>which had been built in the times of the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. St. <hi>Ninian</hi> before he dy'd, divided the Provinces of the <hi>Picts</hi> into Pariſhes, he Ordain'd Prieſts there, and Conſecrated Biſhops, by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop, from whom he receiv'd his Miſſion.</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:96414:49"/>
            <p>He being famous for Miracles, it may not be amiſs to reckon up one. <hi>In the Region of the</hi> Picts, <hi>there was a Prince named</hi> Tudwal, <hi>a man of a proud and high Spirit; he contemning the Admonitions of this man of God, and derogating from his Doctrine and Life, reſiſted him openly: Being one day more then ordinarily troubleſome and rude; God the ſupreme Judge, would not any longer ſuffer the injuries offer'd to his Holy Servant, to paſs unreveng'd, but ſtruck this proud man with an intollerable pain in his Head, by the violence whereof thoſe lofty Eyes of his became utterly Blind; ſo that he who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore impugn'd the Light of Divine Truth, deſervedly loſt this Worlds Light. But upon better conſideration he ſent a Meſſage to the Holy Biſhop, humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him, in imitation of our Lords Benignity, to return to him good for evil, and love for hatred: The Venerable Biſhop hereupon, firſt ſharply reprov'd the Prince, and then touching him, imprinted on his Eyes the Sign of the</hi> Croſs; <hi>when immediately his pains ceas'd, and his Blindneſs was diſſipated. Afterwards this Prince highly Honour'd the Holy Biſhop, and readily granted whatſoever he ask'd of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Country-man <hi>Alcuinus,</hi> in an Epiſtle not Printed, but now extant in Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſhers</hi> Antiquities; Teſtifies the great Fame which this Holy Biſhop had, for Sanctity and Miracles. This Epiſtle is directed to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Prieſt, then living at <hi>Candida Caſa.</hi> While <hi>Alcuinus</hi> liv'd, this following Miracle happ'ned to a Devout Prieſt Celebrating <hi>Maſs</hi> at this Saints Monument, nam'd <hi>Plegils,</hi> he frequently Solemniz'd <hi>Maſs</hi> at the Body of St. <hi>Ninian;</hi> and living a Holy and Virtuous Life, began frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beſeech our Lord, <hi>That he would pleaſe to ſhew viſibly to him, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Verity of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, in the moſt Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> This Prayer he made, not for want of Faith, in the Truth of the Myſtery, but out of an Affection of Devotion and Piety: For the Author ſaith, <hi>That to his great Conſolation, our Lord appear'd to him in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the form of a young Child.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three years after the death of St. <hi>Ninianus,</hi> St. <hi>Germanus</hi> was once more invited into <hi>Britain,</hi> to perfect the good Work which he had formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, in rooting out of the <hi>Pelagian Hereſie,</hi> there ſpreading it ſelf again, the Relation whereof we muſt borrow from the Learn'd Prieſt <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> a Writer of thoſe times, and of moſt perfect Integrity and Sincerity. By a Meſſage from <hi>Britain</hi> addreſs'd to St. <hi>German,</hi> he was advertis'd that that <hi>Peſtilent Hereſie</hi> began to enlarge it ſelf there, and intreated him once more to come over, and maintain the Cauſe of Divine Grace: The Holy Biſhop readily comply'd with this Petition, being delighted to ſpend his ſtrength in the Service of Chriſt: There was joyn'd to him for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion <hi>Severus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Triers,</hi> a perſon of Conſummate Sanctity: In the mean time three Infernal Spirits flying through the whole Iſland, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the return of St. <hi>Germanus,</hi> being forc'd ſo to do againſt their Will: Inſomuch as one <hi>Elaphius,</hi> a Principal perſon of the Country, without any other notice haſt'ned to meet the Holy Biſhops: His Son went with him, upon whom, from the flower of his Youth, a lamentable Infirmity had ſeiz'd, for all his Members were wither'd, and the Hamm of his Leg was ſo drawn together, that by reaſon of the dryneſs of his Thigh he could not ſet his Foot upon the ground; <hi>Elaphius</hi> was attended by almoſt the whole Province: As ſoon as they were met together, an Epiſcopal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was conferr'd on the People, and the Words of Truth Preach'd to them. St. <hi>Germanus</hi> perceiv'd that the generality of the People perſever'd
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96414:49"/>conſtant in the Doctrine which he left among them, and that the fault lay upon a few buiſie perſons, who were preſently condemn'd. As for <hi>Elaphius,</hi> he humbly kneeling kiſs'd the Biſhops Hands, preſenting to him his Lame Son, ſo miſerable a Spectacle, that he mov'd compaſſion in all, eſpecially in the Holy Biſhops mind; St. <hi>German</hi> therefore preſently commanded the young man to ſit down, then handled his contracted Ham, and with his right Hand ſtroak'd all the infirm Members; immediately perfect Health and Strength attended that wholeſome Touch; the wither'd Members reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd their natural Moiſture, and his Sinews their Office and Agility. Thus in the ſight of all, the young man was reſtor'd to his Father, as if he had been new made; the People are aſtoniſh'd at this Miracle, and the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith</hi> is perfectly confirm'd in their minds.</p>
            <p>The Holy Biſhop ſpent his time in Preaching up and down, and the Hearers were every where Converted or Confirm'd: So that by a Univerſal Conſent, the Authors of the Perverſe Doctrine, were brought before the Holy Biſhops, and then baniſh'd out of the Iſland, and the Orthodox Faith remain'd uncorrupted; and all things being thus well compos'd, the Holy Biſhops return'd with a Proſperous Voyage.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, during his ſtay here, St. <hi>German</hi> is recorded to have call'd a Synod, and taking notice that many Churches wanted Paſtors, by which means the People became wavering in their Faith; by common advice he ſelected Learn'd and Pious men, whom he ordain'd Biſhops, and placed in ſeveral Churches: In particular, over all the <hi>Britains;</hi> toward the <hi>Southern</hi> parts, he promoted the Bleſſed man <hi>Dubricius</hi> an Eminent Doctor, to be Arch-biſhop, who was made choice of by King <hi>Mouricus</hi> and the whole Dioceſs: They conſtituted his Arch-Epiſcopal See at <hi>Landaff</hi> with the Kings Conſent, where a Church was Built, and Dedicated to the Honour of the prime Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter.</hi> That an Arch-Epiſcopal See was here thus planted, may be ſome miſtake; for when that See was tranſplanted to <hi>Caerleon,</hi> an Arch-Epiſcopal See indeed was Eſtabliſh'd there; ſo that it may rather ſeem that only an Epiſcopal See was Erected at <hi>Landaff</hi> by <hi>Mouricus,</hi> who is ſaid to be Son of <hi>Theodoric</hi> Prince of <hi>Morgannia,</hi> or <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morganſhire;</hi> which Prince, as Biſhop <hi>Godwin</hi> relates, <hi>Reſign'd his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, and embrac'd a Monaſtical or Hermitical Life: But after, when the</hi> Saxons <hi>invaded the Land, he was drawn out of his Cell, to be Leader of an Army, and Courageouſly ruſhing among the Enemies, receiv'd a Mortal Wound, for which Merit he was Enroll'd in the number of Martyrs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>German</hi>'s next care, after Ordaining Biſhops, was to Viſit the Schools, the Sources of Learning; and he is ſaid to have Studied, or rather Taught for ſometime in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Eſtabliſh'd good Orders there, concerning which we may find an Illuſtrious Teſtimony of our Learned Country-man <hi>Aſſerius,</hi> who liv'd about 800. years ſince, and treating of the Controverſy between the Students of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Grimbaldus,</hi> whom King <hi>Alfred</hi> had call'd out of <hi>France</hi> to govern that Univerſity, affirms, <hi>That the Scholars prov'd by unqueſtionable Teſtimonies of Antient Annals, that the Orders and Inſtitutes of that place, which</hi> Grimbaldus <hi>ſought to change, had been Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Pious and Learned men,</hi> As <hi>Gildas, Melkin, Nemri, Kentigern</hi> and others, who all grew Old in their Studies there, and Adminiſtred all things in Peace and Concord, affirm, <hi>They further ſhew'd, that St.</hi> Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>came to</hi> Oxford, <hi>and abode there half a year, approving wonderfully their Orders and Inſtitutions:</hi> Whether this be not a later Addition to <hi>Aſſerius,</hi> is ſuſpected by ſome.</p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:96414:50"/>
            <p>It will not be amiſs a little to enquire, what Doctrines were taught by St. <hi>Germanus</hi> to whom this Country of ours, was ſo much beholding: For by this enquiry it may appear whether St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> ſent by St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great in the following Age to Convert the <hi>Saxons,</hi> taught them a Religion differing from that which St. <hi>German</hi> profeſs'd; we need go no further in this enquiry then to Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> well known to be Learn'd in Antiquity: The ſixth Chapter of this Treatiſe, call'd, <hi>Analecta Anglo-Britanica,</hi> touching the Practiſes of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline wherewith <hi>Germanus</hi> and <hi>Lupus</hi> Biſhops, imbew'd the <hi>Britains,</hi> may eaſily ſatisfie us in this particular; where he tells us, <hi>That</hi> Germanus <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Auxerre, <hi>and</hi> Lupus <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Troyes <hi>in</hi> Gaul <hi>came into</hi> Britain <hi>to reſtore Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion deprav'd by the Hereſie of</hi> Pelagius <hi>and Errours of</hi> Pagans: <hi>The Doctrines</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>taught by them, as the Fame is, which alſo</hi> Giraldus Cambrenſis <hi>teſtifies, were as followeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Of every Loaf of Bread ſet before them, one Corner they gave to the Poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>They ſat three together at Dinner in memory of the Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>If any met a Religious Monk or Clergy-man in the way, or any one in a Religious Habit, he would preſently lay aſide his Weapons, and with a low inclination of his Head, demand his Benediction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Generally all the People earneſtly demanded Epiſcopal Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Inunction with Holy Chriſm, by which the Holy Ghoſt is confer'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>They ſomtime beſtow'd the Tythe of all their Subſtance, Cattle and Sheep, either when they Marry'd, or undertooke ſome long Pilgrimage, or by the Churches Order ſubmitted to ſome extraordinary Pennance for their Sins: This they call the great Tythes, and two parts thereof they beſtow'd on the Church where they were Baptiz'd; the third they gave to the Biſhop of the Dioceſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Beyond all other External Labours of Mortification, they were moſt Devoted to Pilgrimages undertaken to</hi> Rome, <hi>to Viſit the Monuments of the Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>Beyond any other Nation they expreſs'd a Devout Reverence to Churches and Church-men, to Relicks of Saints, to Portable Bells, Sacred Books, and the Holy Croſs; and this Devotion hath been rewarded with greater Peace, than any other Churches enjoy'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eightly, <hi>Entire ſecurity was obſerv'd in regard of Beaſts ſeeding not only in the Church-yards, but beyond them through all Grounds enclos'd with Ditches, which Biſhops deſign for obſervation of Peace and Indempnity: And greater Churches, to which Antiquity always afforded greater Reverence, have power to grant and enjoyn the obſervation of ſuch Peace and Security for Cattle, whilſt in the Morning they go, and at Evening they Return from their Paſtures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Peace is preſerv'd ſo inviolable, that if any one ſhould incur the Mortal Indignation of his Prince, and ſeek Refuge in a Church, he may enjoy the Fruit of this Peace, both for his Perſon and Goods: Though indeed from ſuch large Immunities beyond the Antient Canons, (which in ſuch caſes allow ſafety of Life to a mans Body) occaſion of great Abuſes have been taken: Scarce any one of theſe Chriſtian practices, but was allow'd by St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Yet is St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> by ſome in thoſe days condemn'd, and St. <hi>German</hi> Abſolv'd.</p>
            <p>Our Anceſtors indeed to teſtifie their high eſteem of the Venerable Biſhop St. <hi>German</hi>'s Sanctity, approv'd by Miracles; after his Death built Chapels and Churches to his Honour; on one of which <hi>Cambden</hi> thus
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96414:50"/>writes, <hi>In</hi> Cornwall, <hi>near the River</hi> Liver, <hi>there is a Village Nam'd from St.</hi> German, <hi>to which, during the</hi> Daniſh <hi>Tumults, the Epiſcopal See of that Province was transfer'd, out of fear, as to a place more remote and ſecure: There a Church had been Erected, and Conſecrated to the Honour of St.</hi> Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, <hi>who Extirpated the</hi> Pellagian <hi>Hereſie ariſing a new among the</hi> Britains. In <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> likewiſe a famous Monaſtery was Conſecrated to him: The River <hi>Owſe</hi> Waters <hi>Selby</hi> a Town well Peopled; there King <hi>William</hi> the I. Founded a Church in memory of St. <hi>German,</hi> who is ſaid, <hi>To have wounded to Death the many Headed</hi> Hydra <hi>of</hi> Pelagianiſm, <hi>often quell'd, and often reviving again:</hi> The Abbots of this Monaſtery, and of St. <hi>Maries</hi> at <hi>York,</hi> were the only <hi>Northern</hi> Abbots, which had Seats in Parliament.</p>
            <p>The memory of St. <hi>German</hi> is alſo much Celebrated among the <hi>Silures</hi> in <hi>North-wales;</hi> for from him a part of <hi>Radnor-ſhire</hi> is call'd <hi>Guarthenian;</hi> for as <hi>Nennius</hi> relates, Vortimer <hi>the Son of</hi> Vortigern, <hi>to ſatisfy for injuries done by his Father to St.</hi> German, <hi>Dedicates that part of the Country to him, where he had been chiefly wrong'd, in memory whereof it took the name of</hi> Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theny; which in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Language, ſignifies, <hi>A Calumny justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto ſince the <hi>Romans</hi> relinquiſh'd their care of <hi>Britain,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Iſland had been govern'd by Petty-Princes, Independent one of another: But in the year 438. by reaſon of the frequent inroads of their Cruel Enemies the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> by common agreement of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, a general Captain of the whole Nation was choſen, after the manner of their Anceſtors in the days of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and the Kingdom eſtabliſh'd in that Captains Line: The choice unhappily fell upon <hi>Vortigern,</hi> born for the deſtruction of his Country; He was a man void both of Courage and Councel, addicted wholly to Carnal Pleaſures, the Slave of moſt Vices, eſpecially of Avarice, Pride and Luxury: He ſollicited, and with the hopes of making her a Queen, Deflowr'd his own Daughter, and of her got a Son, who by Miracle, notwithſtanding his Inceſtuous Birth, through Divine Grace became a Saint, and was nam'd St. <hi>Sanctus.</hi> The Wife of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> was equal to him in Birth, but unlike in Diſpoſition; by her he had three Sons, <hi>Vortimer, Catigern</hi> and <hi>Paſcentius:</hi> While ſhe liv'd he govern'd with Moderation; but after her Death he loos'd the Reins to all wickedneſs: For which being reprov'd by St. <hi>German,</hi> and in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod Excommunicated, he Reveng'd himſelf, by inflicting the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Injuries and Calumnies upon the Holy Biſhop: Before his Election to the Univerſal Government of <hi>Britain,</hi> he was Prince of the <hi>Danmonii,</hi> or as others write, Conſul of the <hi>Geviſſei</hi> Inhabitants of the <hi>South-Weſtern</hi> parts about <hi>Cornwall</hi> or <hi>South-Wales;</hi> which Principality it ſeems he had govern'd well enough, to be preferr'd before his fellow Princes: Though indeed the men of that Age, which <hi>Gildas</hi> terms, <hi>Atramentum aetatis,</hi> afforded ſo little choice, that a Prince not Profligately Vicious, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſome Reputation. However, this unworthy King is recorded a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer of the City of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To leave him a while, we may take notice, that among the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions confer'd by St. <hi>German</hi> on <hi>Britain,</hi> the Election and Conſecration of St. <hi>Dubritius</hi> to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Landaff</hi> was not the leaſt: This <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britius</hi> was by Nation a <hi>Britain,</hi> born in the Province of the <hi>Dunetae,</hi> or <hi>Weſt-Wales;</hi> He was Sir-nam'd <hi>Gainius,</hi> from a River which runs by the place where he was born; His Mothers Name was <hi>Evedila,</hi> famous for
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96414:51"/>her Virtues; and being a Child, had his mind imbew'd with good Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, ſo as in few years he made ſuch proficiency in Learning, that not the Ignorant only, but ſuch as had acquir'd a good degree in Knowledge, repair'd to him, to increaſe their Skill, among whom were St. <hi>Theliaus.</hi> St. <hi>Sampſon</hi> and St. <hi>Aidanus:</hi> In the Soyl of his Nativity, near the River <hi>Vaga,</hi> he choſe a fit Seat, for his own and his Diſciples Studies, and there he ſpent many years in the Charitable Communication of his Learning to others. Afterwards having by the command of an Angel built a Church there, he Preached, and Taught the people wholeſom Chriſtian Doctrine, and by impoſing his Hands, he often Cur'd many Infirmities; and being thus qualified, he was advanc'd by St. <hi>German</hi> to the degree of a Biſhop: He liv'd to a very Old Age for many years after this, he was Tranſlated by <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius</hi> to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Caerleon</hi> in the Province of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> ſo as he will once more occur in our Hiſtory; in the mean time we muſt not omit to ſay ſomething of another Diſciple of St. <hi>German,</hi> nam'd St. <hi>Briocus</hi> a <hi>Britain,</hi> afterwards a Biſhop in <hi>Armorica,</hi> ſo famous that the See of his Biſhoprick, Suffragan to <hi>Tours,</hi> is to this day from his Name called St. <hi>Brieu:</hi> He was deſcended of a Noble Stock, and brought by St. <hi>German</hi> out of <hi>Britain</hi> into <hi>Gaul,</hi> and by him there inſtructed in the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Piety: being enrich'd with ſuch ſaving Doctrine, he return'd into his own Country, and there inform'd his Parents in the true Faith, which he likewiſe Preach'd with great ſucceſs in the Country about. After (deſirous to employ our Lords Talents more Copiouſly,) he came over into <hi>Armorica,</hi> where having ſhed the Beams of Evangelical Light, into the mind of his Kinſman <hi>Cenanus</hi> Count of <hi>Triguier,</hi> he afterwards cleans'd him in the Laver of Baptiſm; then aſſembling ſeveral devout perſons, aſpiring to the Perfection of a Religious Life, he built a Monaſtery, and there by the Liberality of the ſaid <hi>Count,</hi> he laid the Foundation of an Epiſcopal See: And being Conſecrated Biſhop by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Tours;</hi> He, with an admirable Splendour of Virtue and Piety, govern'd the ſaid Dioceſs the ſpace of 30 years: Not long after, being in a Journey, he breath'd forth his ſpotleſs Soul; his Body was carried back to the Church which himſelf had built; and there with great Honour Interr'd, and frequent Miracles are ſaid to be wrought at his Relicks: Thus, as he gave his Name to the Monaſtery, Town and Mother-Church of that Dioceſs, ſo he alſo afforded continual Protection to them.</p>
            <p>In the year of Grace 439. St. <hi>Patrick</hi> had ſpent 8 years in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and then return'd into <hi>Britain,</hi> having fix'd his Epiſcopal Chair at <hi>Armagh;</hi> after that, he is ſaid to repair to the Apoſtolick See, to ratifie his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as he was advis'd by an Angel of our Lord: After his return from thence, he retir'd to the Monaſtery of <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> and there ended his days, as St. <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> before him had done. What were his ſpecial Exerciſes after ſuch his Retirement, is recorded in Hiſtory, <hi>viz. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon Prayer, Fasting and Purity of Life, inſtituting Rules for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtical Profeſſion in</hi> Glaſtonbury, <hi>amongſt ſuch Religious men, as were there Succeſſors of St.</hi> Joſeph <hi>of</hi> Arimathaea: <hi>Theſe St.</hi> Patrick <hi>reduced from an Eremetical to a Caenobitical courſe of Life, giving them Inſtitutes which he had receiv'd from his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle St.</hi> Martin <hi>of</hi> Tours; <hi>who long ſince had cloathed him with the Monaſtical Habit, which was a</hi> White Cowle <hi>of the natural colour of the Wool, over his other Garments, by which Purity and Innocence were denoted.</hi> This faſhion was inſtituted by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monks,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96414:51"/>before the coming of St. <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> who, to diſtinguiſh himſelf from them, aſſum'd a <hi>Black Cowle,</hi> ſo as his Succeſſors were ſtil'd <hi>Black Monks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Glaſtonbury</hi> it was, where St. <hi>Patrick</hi> wrote his Famous <hi>Chart</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, wherein he particularly deſcribes the Iſle then call'd <hi>Ynſwitrin,</hi> where was an Antient Chappel Conſecrated to the Honour of the moſt Bleſſed Virgin; where he found 12 Hermits Succeſſors of the Diſciples of St. <hi>Phaganus</hi> and <hi>Diruvianus,</hi> in which Chart was contain'd, <hi>That they had receiv'd from Pope</hi> Eleutherius <hi>ten years Indulgence; and that by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from our Lord, they had built a Church to the Honour of St.</hi> Michael <hi>the Arch-Angel:</hi> How likewiſe it was ſignified to St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> by a Viſion, <hi>That he was to Honour the Bleſſed Arch-Angel in that place, for the certainty of which Viſion, his Left-hand Wither'd, and was not reſtor'd, 'till he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted his Brethren, with what he had ſeen.</hi> This Chart St. <hi>Patrick</hi> left with two Devout <hi>Iriſh</hi> Monks <hi>Arnulphus</hi> and <hi>Ogmar</hi> his Companions, who reſolv'd to attend on that Chappel.</p>
            <p>The Holy Biſhop further relates, <hi>That he conferr'd an Indulgence of</hi> 100. <hi>days on thoſe who by cutting down Wood clear'd a Paſsage for the Devout Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Chapel, Conſecrated by our Lord himſelf to the Honour of his moſt Bleſſed Mother.</hi> At his return from <hi>Rome,</hi> St. <hi>Patrick</hi> brought with him ſome Relicks of the Holy Apoſtles St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> the Bleſſed Deacon and Martyr, with a Linnen-Cloath, ſprinkled with the Blood of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, which Holy Relicks were reſerv'd there behind the Altar of St. <hi>Patrick:</hi> Theſe Relicks are ſaid to have been brought from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Eudocia</hi> the Wife of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and laid up in the Church of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> the Martyr, and there Piouſly Venerated by Devout Chriſtians. St. <hi>Patrick</hi> is reported after his return from <hi>Rome,</hi> to have Founded many Monaſteries, which he fill'd with Religious men, who willingly fubmitted themſelves to the form of a Religious Life, then preſcrib'd unto them. He is ſaid, <hi>To have fore-told many <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfortunate, and many Proſperous things, which ſhould bef all</hi> Britain; <hi>particularly the Sanctity of St.</hi> David, <hi>then incloſed in his Mothers Womb;</hi> By all which is confirm'd St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s long abode in <hi>Britain</hi> after he had Converted the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Diſciples of St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> the memory of St. <hi>Bachiarus,</hi> whom ſome affirm to be the ſame with <hi>Marcaeus</hi> or <hi>Morthaeus,</hi> is Celebrated. He addicted himſelf to the Study of good Literature at <hi>Caerleon;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an Excellent <hi>Poet</hi> and <hi>Mathematician,</hi> in the Studies whereof in his younger years he entirely imploy'd himſelf; but afterwards he had the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a man excellently vers'd in <hi>Chriſtian Philoſophy;</hi> for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Integrity and Chaſtity, he is ſaid, <hi>To have forſaken his Country, and undertaken a long Pilgrimage;</hi> The <hi>Britains</hi> inſtructed by <hi>Germanus,</hi> accounting Pilgrimages, eſpecially to <hi>Rome,</hi> amongſt the works of Piety: This Holy man might likewiſe abſent himſelf from his Country, in regard the Enormous Vices then and there reigning, could not but afflict his Righteous Soul, and give him cauſe to fear the Miſeries ſoon enſuing, and deſire a Happy opportunity of imploring the Divine aſſiſtance, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of his afflicted Country. Yet he wanted not Detractours, who charg'd him with Levity and Vanity, or worſe; ſo as he was forc'd to declare by writing, <hi>That he undertook thoſe Travels for the Love of God, his own Soul, and his Diſtreſsed Country.</hi> He directed this his Defence eſpecially to St. <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt <hi>Pope</hi> of that Name, as the common Father of all Chriſtians: There is alſo extant a Learn'd and Elegant Epiſtle of his written on this occaſion.</p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:96414:52"/>
            <p>He had heard that a certain Prieſt by the Devils ſuggeſtion had violated a Conſecrated Virgin, for which he was caſt out of the Church without hope of being reſtor'd: The Holy man was deeply afflicted both for the Enormity of the Crime, and Severity of the Puniſhment; whereupon he wrote the ſaid Epiſtle, repleniſh'd as well with Divine Learning as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Charity: This Epiſtle he gave to a Prieſt call'd <hi>Januarius;</hi> him he intreats and ſtrongly Evinces for the Reſtitution of the Offender, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That in the moſt fruitful Field of Gods Church, there grew Herbs Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal to every Wound:</hi> Then addreſſing his Speech to the Guilty Prieſt, <hi>He powerfully exhorts him to Pennance in an incloſed Monaſtery, there to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate his Crime by Faſting and Prayer, and to beg the Interceſſion of the Saints on his behalf; and fearing leaſt he ſhould accumulate his ſin by joyning Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to his Inceſt;</hi> he terrifies him, by ſhewing, <hi>The abominable Exceſs of Marrying one, who was Eſpouſed and Conſecrated to our Lord, when ſhe took the Vail of her Religious Profeſſion:</hi> By which, as in a Mirrour, the ſtate of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, in thoſe times, and the inviolableneſs of <hi>Caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy</hi> and Religious Vows, may be ſeen. He liv'd to a very Old Age, dying in the year 460. or as ſome ſay, long after that.</p>
            <p>In theſe times the <hi>Vandals</hi> by their Incurſions and numerous Armies grievouſly oppreſs'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and upon this opportunity the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> broke their limits, and waſted the Provinces of <hi>Britain,</hi> which had been ſubject to the <hi>Romans,</hi> this happ'ned in the 8th. year of <hi>Vortigern</hi>'s Reign.

            <p>St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> though for his particular Conſolation, he had retir'd himſelf into the ſecure repoſe of a Monaſtery, was yet reſolv'd, when any Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent preſſing neceſſity of Gods Church requir'd his Care and Preſence, he would quit the <hi>Office of</hi> Mary <hi>ſitting at our Lords Feet, and exchange it for that of</hi> Martha<hi>'s Miniſtry, in attending, and providing ſupply to his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities in his Members:</hi> And indeed ſome Diſorders in his new-Founded <hi>Iriſh</hi> Church broke forth, which after ten years quiet repoſe, drew him from his Solitude: What this Diſturbance was, is not known particularly, yet may it perhaps be pick'd out of ſome one or more of thoſe Canons or Decrees which in a Synod, at his return into <hi>Ireland</hi> by him Aſſembled, were conſtituted: Theſe Decrees for many Ages lay conceal'd, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently expos'd to Duſt and Mothes, but have of late by the Induſtry of Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> reſcued and reſtor'd to Light, though in ſeveral places defac'd: Some of them we ſhall here ſelect, for the diſcovery of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Diſcipline practis'd in thoſe times; It was there ordain'd, <hi>That if any Eccleſiaſtical perſon, from the Door-keeper to the Prieſt, ſhall not for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency wear a Tunick, and have his Hair cut after the</hi> Roman <hi>manner, or ſhall permit his Wife to go abroad <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nvail'd, he ſhould be ſeparated from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. That a Monk and Conſecrated Virgin, ſhall not abide in the ſame Lodging, nor Travel in the ſame Chariot: That if a Monk ſhall neglect the Divine Office, or wear long Hair, he ſhall be Excommunicate. That the Almes of Excommunicate Perſons or</hi> Pagans, <hi>ſhall not be receiv'd. That if any Chriſtian ſhall be guilty of Man-ſlaughter, Fornication, or conſulting South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, he ſhall perform Pennance for each Crime, the ſpace of a year: And he that is guilty of Stealing, half a year, of which</hi> 20 <hi>days he ſhall eat Bread only, and be withall oblig'd to Reſtitution: That if any Chriſtian ſhall believe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits may be preſented in a Glaſs, he ſhall be Anathematiz'd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That if any Conſecrated Virginſhall Marry, ſhe ſhall be Excommunicated, 'till ſhe be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and forſake her Adulteries; which having done, ſhe is to perform due Pennance, after which they are not to live in the ſame Houſe or Town. That if any Prieſt ſhall build a Church, he muſt not offer Sacrifice in it, before it be Conſecrated by the Biſhop. That if a Clergy-man be Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, he muſt ſay his Prayers alone, and not in the ſame Houſe with his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; neither muſt he preſume to Offer or Conſecrate 'till he be Abſolv'd: That a Biſhop may not Ordain in another Biſhops Dioceſs without his Conſent, only upon</hi> Sundays <hi>he may offer Sacrifice. That a Clark coming from</hi> Britain <hi>into</hi> Ireland <hi>without a Teſtimonial, be not ſuffer'd to Miniſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no mention made of this, or any other <hi>Iriſh</hi> Synod in any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, except only the Authors of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Life, where this general Paſſage may be found. <hi>The moſt Holy Biſhop St.</hi> Patrick, <hi>together with three other Biſhops, and many Clarks, came to a Fountain call'd</hi> Debach, <hi>which flowes from the ſide of</hi> Crochon <hi>toward the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>there to Celebrate a Synod touching Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, and they ſate near the Fountain; when behold two Daughters of King</hi> Legaren <hi>came early in the morning, to waſh in the ſame Fountain, as Women there uſually did; and there found the Holy Synod with St.</hi> Patrick <hi>near the Fountain.</hi> The Inſcription of this Synod runs thus, <hi>Thanks be given to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Patricius, Auxilius <hi>and</hi> Iſſerninus <hi>to the Prieſts, Deacons and whole Clergy, Health: It is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96414:53"/>better we ſhould premoniſh thoſe who are negligent, then blame things juſt; for</hi> Solomon <hi>ſaith,</hi> It isbetter to Reprove then to be Angry: <hi>The Tenor of our Definition begins thus, If any Captive,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Another Holy Biſhop and Diſciple of St. <hi>Patrick</hi> is once more to be Commemorated, St. <hi>Albeus,</hi> who when he heard that St. <hi>Patrick</hi> had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to our Lord <hi>Engus</hi> King of <hi>Munſter (Momonenſium)</hi> and was with him in the Royal City <hi>Caſſel,</hi> came to Salute them: Now the King and St. <hi>Patrick</hi> joyfully receiv'd him: And the Holy man Reverently Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd his Maſter St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> for he was very Humble. After which this King <hi>Engus</hi> and St. <hi>Patrick</hi> ordain'd, that the Arch-Epiſcopal See of all <hi>Munſter,</hi> ſhould be for ever placed in the City and Chair of St. <hi>Albeus.</hi> The Converſion of King <hi>Engus</hi> was after this manner: When St. <hi>Patrick</hi> had Sown the Faith of Chriſt in <hi>Lemſter,</hi> he Proſecuted his way to the limits of <hi>Munſter;</hi> where the King with great Joy met him, having an earneſt deſire to Believe and be Baptiz'd, and with much Reverence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to his Royal City <hi>Caſſel,</hi> and having been inſtructed, Believ'd, and receiv'd Baptiſm. Three years after this, St. <hi>Patrick</hi> Conſecrated St. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignus</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and there quitting his Sollicitude for others, return'd into <hi>Britain,</hi> to his much deſir'd Solitude of <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> where he ended his days.</p>
            <p>His Succeſſor St. <hi>Benignus,</hi> after ſeven years ſpent in Care of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, Thirſting after Solitude, and willing to ſee his Beloved Maſter, and deſirous alſo to receive from him a moſt perfect Rule of Monaſtical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, by the Admonition of an Angel came to <hi>Glaſtonbury;</hi> and there demanded of St. <hi>Patrick, What place he ſhould make choice of to live in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with God alone, divided from Humane Society?</hi> St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s anſwer was, <hi>That he ſhould purſue Happily his well begun purpoſe,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Go my beloved Brother, and take only your Staff with you; and when you ſhall be arriv'd at the place appointed by God for your Repoſe, whereſoever it be, having fix'd your Staff in the ground, you ſhall ſee it ſlouriſh, and grow Green, there know you muſt make your abode.</hi> Both of them being thus comforted with mutual Diſcourſes, St. <hi>Benignus</hi> accompanied only with a Youth named <hi>Pincius,</hi> began his Journey through Woody and Mooriſh places; but as ſoon, as he was arriv'd at an Iſland, where he ſaw a Solitary place, and which he judg'd ſit for his Habitation, he preſently fix'd his Staff in the ground, which without delay wonderfully grew Green, and brought forth Leaves: There therefore St. <hi>Benignus</hi> reſolv'd to abide until Death in the Service of God alone: And for many years after the ſame Tree, as a witneſs and ſign of the Bleſſed man's Sanctity, remain'd flouriſhing with Green Boughs, over his Oratory. Now though that Solitary place, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from Worldly Converſation, was very proper for the attending God in Divine concerns; yet one Incommodity it had, that no Water was near, ſo that young <hi>Pincius</hi> was compell'd every day to fetch Water almoſt three Miles off: Whence it came to paſs, that partly through Wearineſs, but principally through ſuggeſtions of wicked Spirits, he grew diſ-heartned, which the Holy man perceiving, oft-times endeavour'd to Comfort and Encourage him. At laſt taking compaſſion of his Labours, he Proſtrating himſelf on the ground, Humbly and Heartily beſought our Lord, to open for his Servant a Spring of Water, which might ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupply his Neceſſities: After which, admoniſh'd by an Angelick Viſion, he gave his Staff to young <hi>Pincius,</hi> commanding him to go to a certain
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96414:53"/>place, full of Reeds, and their ſtriking the ground with his Staff, he ſhould without doubt find water, ſo earneſtly deſir'd by them: The Child obey'd, went to the place, and in the Name of the Bleſſed Trinity ſtruck the ground three times, making three Holes in it, with the end of the Staff, which he had no ſooner done, but immediately a Fountain guſh'd forth, from whence to this day a Brook, and that no ſmall one is ſupply'd, being not only productive of Fiſh, but Sanative alſo of many Infirmities.</p>
            <p>This Iſland is ſaid to have the Name of <hi>Ferramere:</hi> Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> ſeems to agree that this Holy Biſhop four years before his Death, came into <hi>Britain,</hi> and relinquiſh'd his Arch Epiſcopal See, for his retirement as aforeſaid. He is ſuppos'd to have ended his Life about the year of Chriſt 455. And 630 years after, His Sacred Body was tranſlated to <hi>Glaſtonbury</hi> by the direction and care of <hi>Thurſton</hi> then Abbot.</p>
            <p>The Example of St. <hi>Patrick</hi> and St. <hi>Benignus,</hi> was imitated by many other <hi>Iriſh</hi> Saints, who, to enjoy perfect vacancy from Worldly Affairs, retir'd into <hi>Britain,</hi> to Conſecrate themſelves unto God in a Life of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity and Contemplation; <hi>Cornwall</hi> was the Province to which they moſt frequently betook themſelves: In ſo much as <hi>Cambden</hi> had juſt ground to ſay, <hi>That the People of</hi> Cornwall <hi>have always born ſuch Veneration to the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Saints that retir'd thither, that almoſt all the Towns in that Province, have been Conſecrated to their Memory:</hi> There is St. <hi>Buriens</hi> Dedicated to an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Religious Woman of that Name; to the Church whereof King <hi>Ethelſtan</hi> in the year 936. gave priviledge of Sanctuary: There is the Town of St. <hi>Jies,</hi> ſo call'd from St. <hi>Jia,</hi> a Woman of ſingular Sanctity. who came thither from <hi>Ireland:</hi> There is St. <hi>Colomb,</hi> ſo nam'd from an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Saint <hi>Columba:</hi> There is St. <hi>Merven,</hi> St. <hi>Erben,</hi> St. <hi>Eval,</hi> St. <hi>Wenn,</hi> St. <hi>Enedor,</hi> and many other places, all which took their Names from <hi>Iriſh</hi> Saints: But one ſpecial <hi>Iriſh</hi> Saint is there Venerated, call'd St. <hi>Piran,</hi> by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> St. <hi>Kiacan,</hi> concerning whom Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> writes, <hi>That he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in</hi> Rome <hi>Chriſtian Religion was moſt purely taught, and Faithfully practis'd, forſook</hi> Ireland <hi>and Travell'd thither, where being arriv'd, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Chriſtian Faith, and Baptiz'd; and there he remain'd</hi> 20 <hi>years, reading Divine Scriptures, and learning Eccleſiaſtical Rules with all diligence.</hi> He adds further, <hi>That at</hi> Rome <hi>he was ordain'd Biſhop, and ſent into</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land 30 <hi>years before St.</hi> Patrick: So that by ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> Writers he is call'd the firſt born of their Saints: Howbeit in the <hi>Roman Martyrology,</hi> St. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> is ſaid to be the firſt, who Preach'd Chriſt in <hi>Ireland;</hi> probable it is that this Saint was one of the firſt 12 Biſhops Conſecrated by St. <hi>Patrick</hi> to propagate the Faith firſt Preach'd in <hi>Ireland</hi> by him, and was by his Example, as many others were, ſo inflam'd with Divine Love, that they forſook all Worldly things, and led an Hermetical Life; for it is Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that St. <hi>Piran,</hi> calling his Diſciples together, and other People, told them, <hi>It was the Divine Will that he ſhould forſake</hi> Ireland, <hi>and go into</hi> Cornwall, <hi>there to expect the end of his days;</hi> And having thus diſmiſs'd them, he ſail'd into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where he built a Manſion for himſelf; and after many Miracles which God had there wrought by him, an Infirmity of Body ſeiz'd upon him, of which Languiſhing, he call'd his Brethren to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whom he Copiouſly inſtructed in the concerns of Gods Kingdom, and commanded his Grave to be made ready; which done, he went down into it, and there render'd up his Soul to God, which, with great Glory was receiv'd into Heaven. His Sacred Body Repoſes in <hi>Cornwall</hi> towards
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96414:54"/>the <hi>Northern</hi> Sea, 15 Miles from <hi>Padſtow</hi> or <hi>Petrockſtow,</hi> and 25 Miles from <hi>Mouſehole; Cambden</hi> mentions a Chappel Dedicated to St. <hi>Piran,</hi> ſeated in a Sandy place, <hi>He was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a Holy man, which came from</hi> Ireland; <hi>and if we may believe the</hi> Legend, <hi>fed ten</hi> Iriſh <hi>Kings and their Armies, with his three Cowes, rais'd to Life dead Men and dead Pigs, and in that place di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted himſelf of his Mortality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the Reign of the Infamous King <hi>Vortigern,</hi> when the <hi>Britains</hi> were ſo Effeminated with Vice; that being unable to reſiſt the Tyranny of their Neighbours, they call'd in from a remote Country more Cruel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants: God to blot out the ſhame and Cowardice of the former Armies, rais'd another <hi>Britiſh</hi> Army of Virgins, conducted by a Royal and Saintly Virgin St. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula.</hi> Some aſſign this ſtory to former times, but for many very conſiderable reaſons, it will ſuit with no other times then we are now upon, <hi>viz.</hi> When <hi>Attila</hi> King of the <hi>Huns,</hi> truly Sir-nam'd Gods ſcourge, waſted <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Regions, with <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> burning the City of <hi>Metz,</hi> Maſſacring Prieſts before the Holy Altars; inſomuch as we read, <hi>That the Holy Biſhop St.</hi> Lupus <hi>was led Captive by</hi> Attila <hi>from</hi> Troyes <hi>to the</hi> Rhine. Now whereas in the Geſts of theſe Holy Virgins, mention is made of the Tyrant <hi>Maximus;</hi> it cannot be intended of that <hi>Maximus</hi> who ſlew the Emperour <hi>Gratian,</hi> but of a younger <hi>Maximus,</hi> deſcended perhaps from the ſtock of the former, and who alſo invaded the Empire, after the death of <hi>Valentinian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed if we conſider the then preſent ſtate of <hi>Britain,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom of theſe Virgins cannot ſo properly be aſcrib'd to any other times then to this, when the poor <hi>Britains</hi> were diſtreſs'd on every ſide, as well by their Revolted Friends the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as by their Enemies the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts;</hi> It was then but lately that <hi>Vortigern</hi> had call'd in the former againſt the latter, and <hi>Hengiſt</hi> with his Brother <hi>Horſa</hi> at firſt Fought ſucceſsfully againſt them: But ſoon after thoſe Valiant Captains deſpiſing their Friends for their Vices and Cowardice, they wrought upon the Luxury of <hi>Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern,</hi> ſeeking to entrap him with the Beautiful <hi>Rowena,</hi> Daughter of the Deceitful <hi>Hengiſt. Vortigern</hi> thus enſnar'd, bought <hi>Rowena</hi> at no leſs price than the whole Province of <hi>Kent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Saxons</hi> begin to pick a quarrel with their Benefactors, and making Peace with the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> turn their Arms againſt the poor <hi>Britains,</hi> threatning to lay the whole Iſland waſte; which Threats they ſoon Executed with all Inhumanity, and in a diſmall manner, took re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of all the Crimes committed by the <hi>Britains</hi> againſt God and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by them profeſs'd: During theſe Miſeries and Troubles, a world of <hi>Britains</hi> of both Sexes, forſook their Country, forſaken by God, and fled into ſtrange Regions, whilſt others ſubmitted to perpetual ſlavery un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Saxons. Gildas</hi> expreſſeth this Calamity thus, ſaying, That very many paſſed over Sea, with grievous Howling and Lamentation; and in their Voyage, joyntly with Mournful Voices, repeated theſe Words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Thou haſt, O Lord, given us up as Sheep to be devour'd, and haſt diſpers'd us among the Nations:</hi> This Complaint ſuits beſt with the weaker Sex, eſpecially thoſe Virgin Martyrs whoſe Relicks were diſpers'd among all the Nations of <hi>Chriſtendom:</hi> Having thus ſettled the time of their Martyrdom; Without all Controverſy they were all <hi>Britains,</hi> though ſome Writers, would have them to be <hi>Iriſh,</hi> without any ſolid reaſon.</p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:96414:54"/>
            <p>The conſtant opinion is, that they were no leſs in number then 11000. This appears by the Hymn uſed in the Church of <hi>Colen,</hi> for the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their memory: The cauſe why ſo many Virgins departed into Foreign parts, is thus related by <hi>Trihemius,</hi> though he erre in point of time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The number of Soldiers</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which under their Captain</hi> Conanus, <hi>went out of</hi> Britain <hi>into</hi> Armorica, <hi>was</hi> 30000 <hi>Fighting-men, and</hi> 100000 Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians <hi>to Till the ground; of theſe many were unmarry'd:</hi> Now <hi>Conanus</hi> and his Company being <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> would not take Wives of the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Pagans:</hi> At that time there was a Prince in that part of <hi>Britain</hi> which is oppoſite to <hi>Armorica,</hi> nam'd <hi>Dionatus</hi> a prudent man, who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Brother <hi>Caradoc</hi> in that Principality. He had a Daughter nam'd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula,</hi> the moſt Beautiful amongſt all the Virgins of <hi>Britain,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all very Devout to our Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conanus</hi> the ninth Prince of <hi>Armorica</hi> ſent Letters to this <hi>Dionatus</hi> Prince of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> entreating him to ſend her for his Wife, and with her a certain number of Virgins, to be Eſpous'd to his Soldiers according to their qualities. <hi>Dionatus</hi> at this requeſt of <hi>Conanus,</hi> gather'd out of all the Provinces of <hi>Britain</hi> 11000 Maids of Noble Blood, and of Inferior fort 60000 Women, partly Maids, and partly ſuch as had been Married; all theſe he commanded to be Tranſported for the purpoſe aforeſaid: Theſe are ſaid to be order'd, and diſtributed into Ranks under ſeveral Leaders.</p>
            <p>Of the 11000 Virgins, St. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula</hi> was Queen, and Captain-General, over the whole Army; to her were joyn'd four other Virgins, who had alſo a General command; their Names were <hi>Pinnoſa, Cordula, Eleutheria</hi> and <hi>Florentia:</hi> Under theſe were appointed eleven others, each of which was to govern a 1000.</p>
            <p>This ſtory hath been ſo corrupted with Prodigious Fictions, that the very Truth of it would have been queſtion'd, if not loſt, had not Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and extraordinary Providence reſcu'd and preſerv'd it. True it is, that neither <hi>Gildas</hi> or <hi>Bede</hi> make any expreſs mention of this Story, the firſt aiming chiefly to inveigh againſt the Vices of the <hi>Britains;</hi> the latter, to relate the Affairs of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> yet both of them give us ſome intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this matter, and St. <hi>Bede</hi> twice expreſly mentions the Celebration of the memory of theſe 11000 Virgin Martyrs, ſuffering for their Faith and Chaſtity at <hi>Colen.</hi> The plain and ſimple Narration of their Geſts is this.</p>
            <p>In the year of our Lord 453. St. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula</hi> and her fore-mention'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions for the purpoſes before rehears'd, ſail'd out of their Port in <hi>Britain</hi> toward <hi>Armorica;</hi> but were ſo driven, and diſturb'd in their courſe, by contrary Winds and Tempeſts, that they were forc'd to ſhelter themſelves at the entrance of the <hi>Rhene</hi> into the Sea: At this time infinite numbers of <hi>Hunns, Gepids</hi> and <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> and other Barbarous Nations of the <hi>North,</hi> by Land and Sea vex'd both <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Gaul.</hi> By Gods ſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who intended to match theſe Holy Virgins to a Spouſe incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably better than their parents had deſign'd for them; in the ſame ſtation where they took Harbour, a great Navy of thoſe Savage Pyrats lay floating, ſo that there was no poſſibility to eſcape them: The poor Virgins are ſoon ſeiz'd on by thoſe Pyrats, who were mingled with many of the old Enemies of <hi>Britain,</hi> the <hi>Picts;</hi> for the chief Captains of this Fleet were <hi>Gaunus</hi> a <hi>Hun,</hi> and <hi>Melga</hi> a <hi>Pict.</hi> Being thus become Captives, they were in Boats con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd up the <hi>Rhene</hi> as far as <hi>Colen;</hi> when they were arriv'd there, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96414:55"/>encompaſs'd with innumerable multitudes of Savages, hating Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Bruitiſh in their Senſual Luſts, both the Faith and Chaſtity of theſe Holy Virgins were at once aſſaulted; ſo as no means either by Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Threats were left un-attempted to expugn their Chaſte Breaſts. In this extremity St. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula</hi> with flaming words, exhorts her Companions, to contemn Death, and to Sacrifice their Chaſte Souls and Bodies to their Caeleſtial Bride groom, and willingly to follow him who call'd them to receive Eternal Crowns of Glory. She tells them, <hi>Though their Enemies be never ſo many, ſtrange, and Cruel, yet they ſhould be unconquerable; unleſs they would willingly yield up the Victory:</hi> With theſe Exhortations the minds of theſe Holy Virgins became ſo full of Courage, that they think their Executioners delay their Death too long; inſomuch, as amongſt ſo vaſt a multitude of tender Maids, not one ſingle perſon was found, which either out of Hope or Fear, yielded to the Wills of the Barbarous Soldiers.</p>
            <p>They all willingly offer their Necks and Breaſts to the Enemies Swords, which with unheard of Cruelty were Imploy'd to exterminate from the Earth ſo many immaculate Souls, who by a Miraculous care of Almighty God, would not ſuffer any Violation in their Bodies: Only one there was among them, who though ſhe would not yield, yet through a Natural fear of Death, ſought by hiding her ſelf to avoid it: Her Name was <hi>Cordula;</hi> yet ſhe the next morning came to the place where her Companions Bodies lay Maſſacred, and condemning her former Cowardlineſs, willingly offer'd her ſelf to her Perſecutors, profeſſing publickly her Faith and Chaſtity; ſo as though ſhe came late to receive her Crown, yet her Courage ſeem'd now greater, in that ſhe oppos'd her ſelf ſingle, to an innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Savage Enemies.</p>
            <p>Her memory is thus particularly Celebrated in the <hi>Roman Martyrology,</hi> the day following the Martyrdom of St. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula</hi> and the reſt; ſuch a Sacrifice as this had never before, nor hath ſince been offer'd to God by his Church. <hi>We read of St.</hi> Agnes, <hi>St.</hi> Katharine <hi>and St.</hi> Lucia, <hi>with a few other Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous examples of Courage and Chaſtity in tender Virgins; but they were ſingle perſons, neither is it un-uſual with God, to ſhew the Power of his Grace, in ſome particular Favourite of his, to exalt the Faith, and confound <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: There have likewiſe been recorded Illuſtrious Examples of multitudes of men, who have freely without reſiſtance ſuffer'd Martyrdom, as the</hi> Thebaean <hi>Legion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But ſuch Courage in men, eſpecially in Soldiers, who daily look death in the face, is not very extraordinary: Whereas here we find, a far more numerous Army, conſiſting of Young Timorous, tender Virgins, offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to innumerable Swords; not one ſingle Soul yields to the Flatteries or fury of their Enemies, one only delays her Suffering, the ſpace of one ſingle night; and then animated as it were, with the united Spirits of all her Companions, next day ſollicits the fury of innumerable Enemies, againſt her ſelf alone, and joyfully triumphing over the rage of Men, and Hell, is joyfully receiv'd amongſt her Companions.</hi>

            <p>They are all generally comprehended under the Title of <hi>Saxons,</hi> and are deſcrib'd to be of the moſt Robuſtious Bodies, and moſt Agile of all the <hi>Germans: Witchindus</hi> the <hi>Monk,</hi> treating of them, ſaith, <hi>The</hi> Franks <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to ſee ſuch men of Tall Stature, Invincible Courage, of unwonted Habits, wearing their long Hair ſpread over their Shoulders and Arms; but eſpecially they admir'd their undaunted Courage:</hi> They wore ſhort Coats, and were Arm'd with long Lances, and their Poſture was to lean upon their Shields, having great Daggers behind upon their Reins. Impatient were they of any Scorn or Diſhonour; inſomuch, as when <hi>Symmachus</hi> being Conſul at <hi>Rome,</hi> had prepar'd great numbers of them to Fight as <hi>Gladiators</hi> for the Entertainment of the People, the night before they were to be brought upon the Theater, 24 of them without any Ropes ſtrangled themſelves.</p>
            <p>Their principal Exerciſe and Skill was in Pyracy, in ſmall Flat-bottom'd Boats, ſo nimble and manageable, that with them they vex'd the Coaſts of <hi>Gaul, Spain</hi> and <hi>Britain;</hi> ſo as the <hi>Romans</hi> were oblig'd all along the Coaſts to appoint Souldiers and Officers, for their Guards, who were call'd, <hi>Counts of the</hi> Saxon <hi>Coaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Religion is thus deſcrib'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That in a Temple of theirs, call'd in their Language <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bſola,</hi> adorn'd with Gold throughout, the People Adore the Statues of three Gods; the moſt Powerful, they call <hi>Thor,</hi> who is placed in the midſt, and on each ſide are ſet the Statues of <hi>Woden</hi> and <hi>Fricca: Thor</hi> they conceiv'd to preſide in the Air, to ſend Thunders, Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Showers and Serene Seaſons, and to govern the Fruits of the Earth. <hi>Woden</hi> ſignifies Valiant, he diſpoſes of Wars, and adminiſters Courage to them againſt their Enemies; <hi>Fricca</hi> beſtows Peace and Pleaſure on men; to her Statue is adjoyn'd a huge <hi>Priapus. Woden</hi> they Carv'd in Arms, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did <hi>Mars;</hi> and <hi>Thor</hi> with a Scepter, anſwering <hi>Jupiter:</hi> From theſe three Deities they nam'd three days of the Week; from <hi>Woden,</hi> whom ſome interpret to be <hi>Mercury, Wedneſday</hi> took its Appellation; from <hi>Thor, Thurſday,</hi> from <hi>Fricca</hi> or <hi>Frea,</hi> ſuppos'd to be the Wife of <hi>Woden, Friday; Tueſday</hi> had its Name from <hi>Tuiſco,</hi> Founder of the <hi>German</hi> Nation, who thence are Nam'd <hi>Tuitſch</hi> or <hi>Dutch:</hi> The Month of <hi>April</hi> they uſually call'd <hi>Eaſter</hi> Month, the Solemnity of our Lords Reſurrection, uſually falling on that Month: To <hi>Woden</hi> they uſually offer'd Humane Sacrifices choſen from their Captives.</p>
            <p>Yet among all theſe Abominations, thoſe Antient <hi>Saxons</hi> had ſome qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities very commendable, eſpecially their Chaſtity; <hi>Tacitus</hi> hath obſerv'd, <hi>That their Marriages were ſevere, and ſuch Chriſt exactly obſerv'd amongſt them; that they were almoſt the only</hi> Barbarians, <hi>who contented themſelves with ſingle Wives, their Wives are confin'd to their Houſes, kept from the ſight of impure Spectacles, and provocations of Intemperate Feaſts: Salvian</hi> alſo hath Honour'd the <hi>Saxons</hi> for their <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> though he blames them for their Cruelty. And after that time St. <hi>Boniface</hi> writes thus of them, <hi>That in old</hi> Saxony, <hi>where was no knowledge of Chriſt; if either a Maid or Wife be guilty of Adultery, they force her to ſtrangle her ſelf, and then burn her Body; or elſe, after they have cut off her Garment to the Waſte, the Chaſte Matrons whip her out of their Confines; and there freſh Women meet her with Whips, or prick her with Knives; and thus they uſe her till they have kill'd her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Foundation of Chaſtity the <hi>Saxon</hi> Churches amongſt us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd ſtable for many Ages: Hence were deriv'd ſo many numberleſs ſwarms of Virgins, and Religious men, deſpiſing all Carnal Temptations
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96414:57"/>and Pleaſures: In no Nation or Church ſuch frequent Examples have been afforded of Princes; willingly and by Vow abſtaining from Lawful and Matrimonial Pleaſures; of Virgins willingly expoſing their Lives to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Purity; yea Disfiguring themſelves, for their appearing Odious to thoſe who otherwiſe would have violated their Chaſtities: But now alas Chaſtity is not ſo much eſteem'd.</p>
            <p>It will not here be amiſs to take a view of the <hi>Britains</hi> of that Age, that we may ſee, God did not forſake them, till they had fill'd up the meaſure of their ſins by all manner of Impieties: A more convincing witneſs whereof cannot be found then their own <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtorian <hi>Gildas,</hi> who ſeems to have his Pen directed by God, on purpoſe to write, like another <hi>Jeremias,</hi> the heavy Judgments inflicted on his Country; and the more heavy Crimes, from Heaven exacting thoſe Judgements: The whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion generally, is by him acknowledg'd guilty of all manner of Vices, joyn'd with extream Ingratitude to God; for whereas after the Incurſions of the <hi>Picts</hi> and, <hi>Scots</hi> there enſued ſuch wonderful Plenty of all things, as no former Age coul parallel; the <hi>Britains</hi> turn'd this into wantonneſs, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more then ever, in all manner of Uncleanneſs and Luxury; which Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was accompanied with hatred of the Truth; ſo that if any one in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ſhew'd any ſign of a Chriſtian Life, the general hatred of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> ſoon purſu'd him: From this contempt of Divine Benignity, God ſought reclaim them, by his ſcourges of Peſtilence and Famine, by which ſuch multitudes periſh'd, that the Living were not able to bury the Dead. <hi>Princes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Gildas</hi>) <hi>were Anointed, but not by our Lord, for thoſe were made choice of to reign, who were moſt Eminent for their Cruelty, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after Murder'd by their Anointers, and others more Feirce and Savage were Elected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the way we may hence perceive, that in thoſe Antient times, the Solemne Ceremony of Anointing Kings was in uſe: This is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> who declares, <hi>That in his time, what Prince ſoever was rais'd to the heighth of Royal Dignity, receiv'd the Sacrament of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction.</hi> The manner how this Unction was adminiſtred, is ſtill extant in the Book call'd <hi>Ordo Romanus: Selden</hi> indeed will needs have this paſſage in <hi>Gildas</hi> to be taken Metaphorically, contrary to the conſtant ſucceeding Practice among the <hi>Saxons:</hi> To ſhew what little hopes our Hiſtorian had of any amendment amongſt the <hi>Britains;</hi> he further chargeth the Eccleſiaſticks of thoſe times, who ſhould have been Correctors of others, to have been yet more corrupt than the Laity: <hi>For,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thoſe Enormous ſins were not only committed by Secular men, but by Gods own flock and the Paſtors thereof:</hi> Thoſe who ought to have been Examples of Piety to the People, were moſt of them, diſſolv'd with Wine, and all manner of Exceſs: Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, Contentions, Envy againſt one another, tore them into Factions; Inſomuch, as <hi>Gildas</hi> Compil'd a particular Treatiſe, call'd, <hi>The Correction of the Clergy,</hi> which he begins thus, Britain <hi>has Prieſts, but many of them Impudent; It has Clergy-men, but great numbers of them Covetous Oppreſſors, Deceitful Paſtors, or rather Wolves to deſtroy the Souls of their flock, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no regard to the Spiritual good of their People; but only ſeeking to fill their own Bellies: They poſſeſs the Houſes of the Church for Lucres ſake only: If they teach the People, they render that Inſtruction fruitleſs, by their ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: They ſeldom Sacrifice, and more ſeldom approach the Altars with Pure Hearts,</hi> &amp;c. He further chargeth the Clergy with <hi>Simony, Purchaſing Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Biſhopricks with Money, of the then Ruling Tyrants,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:96414:57"/>
            <p>Hence we may plainly perceive, why the Nation was deliver'd over to the Sword; and the Barbarous Nations which came for its Puniſhment, were for their reward call'd to embrace the Chriſtian Faith: Neither was <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> alone thus puniſh'd, but all the Provinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> were made De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate by innumerable Armies of Barbarous People from the <hi>North;</hi> and the Church of God ſo afflicted, as if our Lord had caſt off all care of his flock: But if we conſider conſequents, we ſhall find that the Catholick Church, thereby receiv'd a great increaſe both in the number of Profeſſors, and the Zeal of their Profeſſion; for though thoſe Barbarous Nations for a while Perſecuted the Church, yet e're long our Lord ſubdued their Minds, and thoſe ſtrong Natural Paſſions of theirs were imploy'd in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing Gods Church; inſomuch, as the Apoſtles time and Primitive Age could ſcarce afford ſuch Heroical Examples of Chriſtian Zeal, Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Contempt of the World, as thoſe Barbarous People once Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted did: So Healthful is the Severity of God towards his People.</p>
            <p>Many Hiſtorians accuſe the Cowardly Sloth of King <hi>Vortigern,</hi> as if he weary of the Troubles of War, choſe rather with his Money to Hire Stipendiary Strangers, than to train up his own Subjects to reſiſt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and therefore invited the <hi>Saxons</hi> to Fight for the <hi>Britains:</hi> But as <hi>Beda</hi> ſaith, <hi>This was done by the common advice of the Nation;</hi> For a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was aſſembled, wherein it was thought beſt by all, as well as by the King, to demand Aide of the <hi>Saxons:</hi> Which reſolution, doubtleſs was order'd by Divine Providence, to puniſh the Impious <hi>Britains,</hi> as the event declares; for <hi>Gildas</hi> reflecting on the madneſs of this Conſultation, thus exclaims, <hi>O the profound Blindneſs of the</hi> Britains <hi>minds! O the Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of their Senſes! Theſe</hi> Saxons <hi>at whoſe Names they trembled, when they were abſent, are now by the fooliſh Princes, invited to live in their own Houſes, ſo ſenſeleſs was their Councel:</hi> How ſenſeleſs ſoever it was, Ambaſſadors were ſent into <hi>Germany,</hi> men of the higheſt repute, and ſuch as might moſt worthyly repreſent their Country: <hi>Witchindus</hi> thus deſcribes the order of this Embaſſage. <hi>Fame</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>loudly proclaiming the Proſperous Victories of the</hi> Saxons, <hi>the</hi> Britains <hi>ſent Meſſengers to them to beg their aſſiſtance, who did it in theſe words,</hi> viz. <hi>O Noble</hi> Saxons, <hi>our miſerable Country-men the</hi> Britains, <hi>wearied and even conſum'd with the frequent Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their Enemies; having heard of your glorious Victories, have ſent us humbly to implore your Aide; in recompenſe whereof, they offer to you a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Spacious and Abounding with all things: We have hither to liv'd Happily under the Protection of the</hi> Romans; <hi>after them, we know no Nation better than your ſelves, to whom we may have recourſe; we therefore deſire to ſhelter our ſelves under the Wings of your Courage,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>After the <hi>Angli</hi> gave their own Name to it: Beſides, after 150 years, by the coming of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> they became <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and of Waſters of the Country, became more Gentle and Civil Inhabitants thereof: They firſt poſſeſs'd themſelves of the Ille of <hi>Thanet</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and there firſt land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a place call'd <hi>Wipped-fleet,</hi> from <hi>Wipped</hi> a <hi>Saxon</hi> Commander there, after ſlain: They being thus landed, about the year of our Lord 450. the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> invaded <hi>Britain</hi> with a mighty Army, waſting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces as they came along: <hi>Vortigern</hi> gathers his Soldiers and Auxiliary <hi>Saxons</hi> together, and march'd beyond the River <hi>Humber;</hi> when they came to a Battle, the <hi>Britains</hi> had little need to Fight, for the <hi>Saxons</hi> Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch Courage, that the Enemies, formerly accuſtom'd to Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſoon turn'd their backs, and fled: <hi>Vortigern</hi> therefore having by their Valour obtain'd the Victory, increas'd his Liberality to them, and gave to <hi>Hengiſt</hi> their Captain great Poſſeſſions in <hi>Lyndſey,</hi> part of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to maintain him and his Soldiers. <hi>Huntingdon</hi> will needs have this Battle at <hi>Stanford</hi> in the <hi>Southern</hi> parts of the ſame Shire; adding, <hi>That the</hi> Picts <hi>and</hi> Scots <hi>had march'd ſo far without oppoſition; and that they were only Arm'd, and Fought with Darts and Lances; but the</hi> Saxons <hi>with Battle-Axes and long Swords, whoſe force and weight their Enemies not being able to ſuſtain, were ſoon put to flight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as touching the Land thus given to <hi>Hengiſt, Cambden</hi> gives us this Relation out of our Annals: Hengiſt <hi>having ſubdu'd the</hi> Picts, <hi>beſides large Poſſeſſions conferr'd on him in other places, requeſted</hi> Vortigern <hi>to beſtow upon him in that Province, ſo much ground as he could encompaſs with an Oxes-Hide, which being obtain'd, he cut it into Thongs extreamly Thinn, and with it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd a great Territory, in the midſt of which he built a Caſtle; which by the Name perpetuates the memory thereof; for it is call'd</hi> Thong-Caſtle: As <hi>Carthage</hi> for many Ages remain'd a witneſs of <hi>Dido's</hi> Fraud; for by theſame ſlight ſhe obtain'd the Seat where ſhe built that City; ſo does this Caſtle, ſtill offer to our memories the Simplicity of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and Craft of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> ſuch a gift could not ſatisfie the Ambition of <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> whoſe aim was to be Maſter of the whole Iſland. The ſubtile man therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming of the Kings Friendſhip and eaſineſs, thus addreſs'd to him, <hi>My Lord the King, you ſee how your Enemies diſquiet you on all ſides; if you pleaſe, therefore we will ſend into our Country, for the increaſe of our numbers with new Recruits.</hi> The King commanded him to do ſo withour delay, that he might be freed from the fear of his Enemies: <hi>Hengiſt</hi> ſends Meſſengers accordingly, who quickly return'd with 18 Ships laden with Soldiers; and not with Soldiers only, but with a fair Lady, the Daughter of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt,</hi> whoſe Beauty and Flatteries ſo bewitch'd the King, that to pleaſe her, he betray'd both his Faith and Kingdom. <hi>Malmsburienſis</hi> reports this

               <hi>Rowena</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Hengiſt, To be for Beauty the Miracle of Nature, admir'd by all that look'd on her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hengiſt</hi> commands a Magnificent Feaſt to be provided for the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his newly arriv'd Soldiers, to which the King is Invited: He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points his Daughter to perform the Office of Cup-bearer to the King, that he might ſurfeit his Eyes with her Beauty. The deſign took effect, for the King being a Slave to Beauty, was preſently wounded with the Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Maids looks, and the Elegancy of her Geſtures nouriſhing in his mind a hope to enjoy her: Without delay he demands her for his Wife. The Crafty Father pretends ſuch a Marriage would be too mean for ſo great a Prince, but with great importunity, yields his unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling willing conſent; to reward which, and for a Dowry to his Daughter, the King gives him the whole Province of <hi>Kent,</hi> ſome writers ſay, <hi>This Feaſt and Marriage were Celebrated at</hi> Thong-Caſtle, <hi>where</hi> Rowena <hi>was inſtructed by her Father to Drink a Health to</hi> Vortigern <hi>after the</hi> German <hi>manner:</hi> However, certain it is, that beſides the infinite Damage to the Kingdom by Alienating ſo conſiderable a Member as <hi>Kent,</hi> ſo convenient for the harbouring of new Forces: this Marriage was in a high degree Pernicious, becauſe the King had another Wife, and for that being a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> he had joyn'd himſelf to a <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatreſs.</p>
            <p>Preſently after this unhappy Marriage, the Voyage and Martyrdom of St. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula</hi> and her Companions happ'ned, whoſe Heroical Conſtancy, might help to wipe out that ſtain, which the Luſt of this King had caſt upon the Nation: <hi>Hengiſt</hi> having thus Proſtituted his Daughter to the King, who Proſtituted his Country to <hi>Hengiſt;</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> began to ſwell with ambitious Thoughts, and knowing the Nation generaily diſ-approv'd the Kings Marriage, and cooled in Affection and Duty to him, began to pick quarrels with him, and contemn'd him for his Vices: They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſought occaſions of War againſt the <hi>Britains,</hi> whom God had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd to be puniſh'd for their Crimes; ſo that <hi>Hengiſt</hi> boldly requir'd of his Son-in-Law the King, a more Plentiful ſupply of Proviſions, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would renounce the League between them, and lay waſte the whole Iſland; which Threats were preſently attended with diſmall Effects: For the <hi>Saxons</hi> entring a League with the <hi>Picts,</hi> gather'd an innumerable Army, which, without reſiſtance, ſpoil'd the whole Country.</p>
            <p>Thus a flame kindled by the hands of theſe <hi>Pagans,</hi> prov'd a juſt revenge of the Crimes of this Nation; which Crimes were the leſs Pardonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe committed by thoſe who profeſs'd themſelves the People of the True God: No wonder was it, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> met with ſo little reſiſtance, ſeeing the Kings Marriage with an Infidel Lady, his Divorce from his Lawful Queen, and the delivering up ſo conſiderable a part of his Kingdom to Strangers, had rais'd high Diſcontents againſt him among his Subjects: However, by common conſent, they beſought him to take Pity on his Country, ready to Periſh, at leaſt not to neglect his Faith and the Church of God, in danger to be deſtroy'd by Heathen Miſcreants; which if it ſhould happen by his default, and that the Diabolical Worſhip of Idols ſhould prevail againſt Gods true Religion, it would be puniſh'd, by his own and his Peoples Eternal Miſery.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops and Clergy repeated theſe Admonitions to him, but all in vain: wherefore, <hi>Vortigern</hi> became deſerted of all his Subjects, and the Nobility by unanimous conſent, rais'd into his Throne his Son <hi>Vortimer.</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:96414:59"/>No writers affirm that <hi>Vortigern</hi> was Depos'd, but Deſerted by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as a Prince given up to his Pleaſures, and therefore incapable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Ambitious Deſigns of <hi>Hengiſt;</hi> againſt whom the whole Nation was reſolv'd to joyn all their Forces to expel him out of the Kingdom. <hi>Vortimer</hi> was an earneſt Incendiary of the War againſt theſe <hi>Saxons,</hi> being reſolv'd to endure their Boldneſs and Ambition no longer: And for this reaſon moſt of the <hi>Britains</hi> follow'd him; not that the Nobles depriv'd <hi>Vortigern</hi> of his Royal Authority, or Created <hi>Vortimer</hi> King; as a late <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Writer inſinuates: However this Change could not but work Diviſions in the Kingdom, for <hi>Vortigern</hi> for the ſpace of ſixteen years, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had poſſeſſion of the Kingdom, could not want ſome Adherents to take his part; ſo as thoſe Diviſions could not but give too great advantage to the Progreſs of the Ambitious <hi>Saxons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vortimer</hi> being thus exalted, either as Aſſociate with his Father in the Throne, or as General of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Forces; haſten'd to give proof of his Country-mens good advice in their Election of him; and taking notice of the Craft and Ambition of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> ſtudy'd how to drive them out of the Nation, vehemently urging his Father to attempt it; ſo that an Army was ſoon rais'd, this happ'ned the ſeventh year after their firſt entrance: Great preparations were made on both ſides; at laſt they came to a Battle, which was fought in the Fields of <hi>Egleſtirpe,</hi> now call'd <hi>Alesford,</hi> a Town in <hi>Kent</hi> waſh'd by the River <hi>Medway:</hi> On the <hi>Britains</hi> ſide were three chief Captains, who led each a third part of the Army; <hi>Ambroſius Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi> led the firſt Diviſion, <hi>Vortimer</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Catigern</hi> a younger Brother of <hi>Vortimer</hi> led the third: The <hi>Saxon</hi> Army was Conducted by <hi>Hengiſt</hi> and <hi>Horſa:</hi> In the beginning of the Battle, <hi>Horſa</hi> ſet upon the Army of <hi>Catigern</hi> with ſuch Vigour, that it was diſperſs'd like Duſt before the Wind, and <hi>Catigern</hi> the Kings Son was ſlain; but his Brother <hi>Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> a Prince of admirable Courage, falling ſide-ways into <hi>Horſa</hi>'s Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, routed them, and kill'd <hi>Horſa,</hi> the moſt Valorous of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> the remainder of his Forces fled to <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> who then was Fighting with Invincible Courage againſt <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> ſo as the whole weight of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate lay upon <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> who being Aſſaulted, and brought into great ſtraits, by the Acceſſion of <hi>Vortimer</hi>'s Forces, after he had a good while ſuſtain'd the impreſſion of the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> Army, was at laſt overcome, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to fly, which he had never done before.</p>
            <p>Yet this Victory coſt the <hi>Britains</hi> dear, for great numbers of them were ſlain; nay ſome Authors affirm, <hi>That</hi> Hengiſt <hi>obtain'd the Victory:</hi> The Body of <hi>Horſa</hi> was Buried at a place not far from the Battle, in memory of him call'd <hi>Horſtead; Catigern</hi>'s Body is ſuppos'd to have been Buried at <hi>Aylsford,</hi> by the <hi>Saxons</hi> call'd <hi>Eglesford,</hi> by the <hi>Britains Saiſſeneag-Haibail,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Saxons</hi> were there overcome. To teſtifie which Victory, there ſtill remain four great Stones ſtanding upright, after the manner of <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henge</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> which from <hi>Catigern</hi> are vulgarly and imperfectly call'd <hi>Keith-cotyhouſe. Horſa</hi> thus dead, the <hi>Saxons</hi> exalted <hi>Hengiſt</hi> to the Title of the King of <hi>Kent.</hi> The ſame year he is reported to have Fought three Battles againſt the <hi>Britains;</hi> but being unable to reſiſt the Valour of <hi>Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> he was forc'd to retire into the <hi>Iſle of Thanet,</hi> where he was daily Aſſaulted with <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ships: At laſt the <hi>Saxons</hi> leaving their Wives and Children in <hi>Thanet,</hi> return'd to <hi>Germany,</hi> to call in greater Forces.</p>
            <pb n="113" facs="tcp:96414:59"/>
            <p>The year after, dy'd the Glorious King <hi>Vortimer,</hi> the fourth year after he was aſſum'd to the Participation of the Regal Authority. Some Writers affirm, <hi>He dy'd a Natural Death;</hi> others ſay, <hi>He dy'd by Poiſon, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to him by his Mother-in-Law</hi> Rowena, <hi>into whoſe mind the Devil ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, to cauſe a Servant of his to give him Poiſon; which he having drunk, and perceiving the approach of Death, he divided his Treaſures among his Soldiers, earneſtly exhorting them to Fight Couragiouſly for their Country. Moreover, He commanded a Pyramid of Braſs to be made, and plac'd in the Haven where the</hi> Saxons <hi>uſually landed, upon which Pyramid his Body ſhould be laid; that the Enemies ſeeing the Body of ſo Valorous a Prince, might be frighted back into their own Country.</hi> More probable it is, that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Statue ſhould be plac'd on the Pyramid; for being a Chriſtian Prince, he was Decently and Solemnly Buried after the Chriſtian manner: And it is ſaid, <hi>He was Buried in the City of the</hi> Trinobantes, <hi>now</hi> London, <hi>and with him was Buried the Crown and Glory of the</hi> Britiſh <hi>Nation.</hi> Beſide his Courage, he is ſaid to be Eminent in other Virtues, eſpecially Piety; and ſome ſay, <hi>In his War againſt the</hi> Saxons, <hi>he bore in his Enſign the Image of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> To which Devotion of his, we may impute his Victories, or at leaſt to his Pious and Charitable care in reſtoring the Churches deſtroy'd by the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The year after <hi>Vortimer</hi>'s death, <hi>Hengiſt</hi> return'd out of <hi>Germany</hi> with greater Forces, and took a firmer poſſeſſion of his <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Kingdom, and for the better Eſtabliſhment of his Family therein, joyn'd his Son <hi>Aeſca</hi> with him in the Regal Power. To oppoſe them the <hi>Britains</hi> invade his Country with a great Army; conſiſting of four great Bodies, Conducted by four Valiant Captains; but when the Conflict was begun at <hi>Cregan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> the <hi>Britains</hi> found themſelves too weak for the <hi>Saxons;</hi> which were new Recruited with great numbers of choſen Robuſtious Soldiers, who with their Swords and Battle-Axes, cleft aſunder the Bodies of the <hi>Britains:</hi> Yet did they not give ground, till their four Captains were ſlain; but afterwards were ſo terrified, that they fled as far as <hi>London,</hi> and never after had the Courage to bring an Army into <hi>Kent</hi> again, ſo that <hi>Hengiſt</hi> and his Son quietly enjoy'd that Kingdom, fixing their Palace at <hi>Canterbury:</hi> Thus began this new Kingdom of <hi>Kent</hi> in the eighth year after the Arrival of the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not probable that this exalting of <hi>Vortimer,</hi> was any Depoſal of his Father; for <hi>Vortimer</hi> being Dead, his Father continu'd King, and for a while gave proof of his Courage in repreſſing the Ambition and Violence of <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> though after he return'd to his former Licentious Slothfulneſs.</p>
            <p>Now during theſe Wars, <hi>Hengiſt</hi> is recorded to have exercis'd extream Cruelty in all places where his Armies came, and eſpecially in <hi>Kent,</hi> againſt Prieſts and Holy Virgins, great numbers of which he caus'd to be Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, Demoliſhing Churches, and Profaning Altars. Among the Victims of his Barbarous Cruelty, the memory of <hi>Voadinus</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> only remains in our <hi>Engliſh Martyrology;</hi> who being a man of great Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, reprov'd <hi>Vortigern,</hi> for repudiating his Lawful Wife, and Marrying an Infidel; which ſo inflam'd <hi>Hengiſt</hi> with rage, that he commanded the Holy Biſhop with many other Prieſts and Religious men to be ſlain; <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> declares, <hi>That great numbers of Biſhops and Prieſts were Maſſacred by this</hi> Saxon <hi>King:</hi> And St. <hi>Bede</hi> relates more particularly the Rapines, Cruelties and Devaſtations of this Impious King, wherewith he miſerably fill'd the whole Iſland.</p>

            <p>The year of Grace 461. is noted with an Act of moſt Perfidious Cruelty; perpetrated by this Barbarous Prince: His Ambition was not ſatisfied with the Kingdom of <hi>Kent,</hi> ſo as he reſolv'd to enlarge his bounds in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> by any means; and finding that by exerciſe of War, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Courage increas'd; he therefore turn'd his Thoughts, to invent ſome Stratagem for the compaſſing his Deſignes. He inſinuates himſelf into the minds of <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigern</hi> and his Nobility, as if he were deſirous of Peace and Amity with them, which if they would grant, he would turn his Arms againſt the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> and drive them out of the Iſland; quickly did he obtain belief from the eaſy Nature of <hi>Vortigern;</hi> whereupon a meeting is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> with this caution, that each King ſhould be attended with 300 only, and thoſe un-arm'd; and at this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were to treat of the Conditions of Peace: The place appointed for this Fatal Aſſembly, was a Plain near <hi>Sorbiodunum,</hi> or Old <hi>Salisbury,</hi> a City ſeated in the Province of the <hi>Belgae;</hi> wherein remains a Monument of a Dire Tragedy; for both ſides being met, a great Feaſt was prepar'd for the <hi>Britains,</hi> at which the Articles of Agreement were to be ratified, by mutual Promiſes and Oaths: Towards the end of this Feaſt, when they were diſſolv'd in Wine, <hi>Hengiſt</hi> on a ſuddain, call'd aloud, <hi>To Arms,</hi> which was the Watch-word agreed among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who immediately drew out ſhort <hi>Swords,</hi> conceal'd under their Cloathes, and quickly ſlew their Un-arm'd Gueſts the <hi>Britains:</hi> Howbeit, which is remarkable, <hi>Eldol</hi> the Valiant Conſul or Governour of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> ſnatching up a ſtake, by Chance lying near, with it ſlew ſeventy of the Treacherous <hi>Saxons.</hi> A Monument of this Barbarous Tragedy, not long after rais'd by the <hi>Britains,</hi> continues to this day, and is Vulgarly call'd <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> Upon <hi>Salisbury</hi>-Plain; where, in a ſpace of ground compaſs'd with a Ditch, are placed, as in a three-fold Crown, Stones of an incredible vaſtneſs, ſome of them 28 foot in hight, and 7 in breadth; over many of which, other great Stones are plac'd a-croſs; <hi>Cambden</hi> believes, That this Monument was rais'd, in memory of this Treachery by <hi>Ambroſius Aurelianus,</hi> or his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>

            <p>In this Slaughter the <hi>Saxons</hi> took <hi>Vortigern</hi> Priſoner, and the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing bound him with Chains, threatning Death, unleſs he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up 38 of his Cities and Strong-holds: <hi>Vortigern</hi> to ſave his Life, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yielded to their demands; which being confirm'd by Oath, they gave him his Liberty: And firſt they ſeiz'd upon the City of <hi>London,</hi> then <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and then <hi>Wincheſter:</hi> All which adjoyning Provinces they waſted, killing the Inhabitants: They Levell'd with the ground all Churches, and Buildings belonging to Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, kill'd the Prieſts near the Altars, burn'd all Books of Holy Scripture, and heap'd Earth on the Sepulchres of Martyrs: Religious men to eſcape their fury, were ſain to fly into Deſarts, Woods and Rocks, carrying with them the Relicks of Saints.

            <p>The King thus Father of St. <hi>David,</hi> is call'd <hi>Xanthus,</hi> and his Mother by ſome Nam'd <hi>Melaria:</hi> The eminent Sanctity of this Child, the Fruit of his Holy Mothers Faſting Chaſtity and Prayer, was by another Divine Oracle fore-told, a little before his Birth: For when <hi>Gildas Albanius</hi> was from the Pulpit teaching a great Congregation, on the ſuddain he became dumb and un-able to ſpeak, but afterwards broke forth into theſe words; <hi>A Holy Woman call'd</hi> Nonnita, <hi>now preſent in this Church, is great with Child, and ſhall ſhortly be brought to Bed of a Son, full repleniſh'd with Grace: It was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to him that I was hindred from ſpeaking, by a Divine Power reſtraining my Tongue. This Child ſhall be of ſo Eminent Sanctity, that none in theſe our parts are comparable to him; I will ſurrender this Region to him, who will from his Infancy by degrees increaſe in Grace and Sanctity: An Angel Gods Meſſenger hath reveal'd this unto me.</hi> This Holy Child not long after born, was Baptiz'd by <hi>Albeus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who at that time by Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence arriv'd there, at a place call'd <hi>Portcleu:</hi> During his Childhood, he was Educated at a place nam'd the <hi>Old Buſh,</hi> by the <hi>Cambrians Henme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen;</hi> and by the <hi>Latines Menevia;</hi> he grew every day repleniſh'd with Grace, and being of a perſpicacious wit, proceeded in the Study of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, far beyond all other Children of his Age: This Child after, became the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Menevia,</hi> to which place he tranſlated the Biſhoprick of <hi>caerleon,</hi> and which from him was call'd St. <hi>Davids,</hi> for his Learning, Sanctity and Miracles, worthily Celebrated by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>Whilſt <hi>Vortigern</hi> lurk'd Ingloriouſly in the Mountains of <hi>Wales,</hi> buſie in building a Caſtle for his Security; the middle Provinces of <hi>Britain,</hi> leſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96414:61"/>un-guarded, were expos'd to the fury of the <hi>Saxons:</hi> This Caſtle had the Name of <hi>Genorium,</hi> afterward of <hi>Caer Vortigern: It is plac'd</hi> (ſaith <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) in a vaſt Solitude, fearful for the Horrour of Mountains, and narrow turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the paſſage to it:</hi> To this place <hi>Vortigern</hi> the Plague of his Country, withdrew himſelf, to ſeek refuge for his own perſon, and there ſpent his time in conſulting <hi>South-ſayers,</hi> eſpecially his <hi>Magician Merlin:</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Britains</hi> thus deſerted by their King, were compell'd to ſeek one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and therefore ſend Meſſengers into the leſſer <hi>Britain</hi> beyond Sea, to <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius</hi> and his Brother <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terpendragon,</hi> who for fear of <hi>Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern</hi> were retir'd thither. Them they beſeech to return into their own Country, that having expell'd the <hi>Saxons</hi> and their hated King <hi>Vortigern,</hi> they might receive the Crown of <hi>Britain.</hi> Theſe Brothers now of ripe Age, proſecute their Journey accordingly, attended with Ships and Arm'd Souldiers: All Authors ſpeak of <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> as a Modeſt Prince, who alone of the <hi>Roman</hi> race, had remain'd alive, after ſo great a Tempeſt of Wars and Changes, in which his Parents, who had worn the Royal Purple were ſlain: It may be preſum'd, that he was the Son of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who about 50 years before, pretended to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and in that attempt was ſlain in <hi>Gaul,</hi> for that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had other Children beſides <hi>Conſtans,</hi> who is ſaid to be his Eldeſt Son when <hi>Vortigern</hi> was choſen; this <hi>Ambroſius</hi> was a Competitor with him for the Crown, and failing therein, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to quit his Right and Country, and to retire himſelf into little <hi>Britain;</hi> from whence notwithſtanding, in the Generous <hi>Vortimer</hi>'s time, he return'd; and Fought for him Valiantly againſt the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as is before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, but after his Death it ſeems, retir'd to his former refuge: The return of theſe Princes, wrought a greater dread in <hi>Vortigern,</hi> then the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall omit the Fable of the two <hi>Dragons</hi> coming out of the Lake, and how the <hi>Red Dragon</hi> was deſtroy'd by the <hi>White,</hi> and proceed to the Geſts of our <hi>Aurelius,</hi> quickly ſet upon by the <hi>Saxons</hi> after his Landing.</p>
            <p>For King <hi>Hengiſt</hi> and his Son <hi>Eſca,</hi> in the 17th. year after the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and in the year of Grace 465. gather'd an Invincible Army: On the other ſide the <hi>Britains</hi> uniting all their Forces, oppos'd them with an Army gallantly rang'd into twelve Bodies: The Battle was fought near the famous Port of <hi>Rochborow;</hi> the Fight continu'd long, and with little advantage; untill at laſt, <hi>Hengiſt</hi> having ſlain the twelve Leaders, forc'd the <hi>Britains</hi> to fly, but himſelf loſt great numbers of his Soldiers and Principal Officers; amongſt the reſt a great Prince of his Nation, call'd <hi>Whipped,</hi> in memory of whom the place of the Battle took the Name of <hi>Whippedſtede:</hi> So that the <hi>Saxons</hi> themſelves bewail'd this Victory, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they after that time, take the confidence to enter into the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> Border, nor the <hi>Britains</hi> to Invade <hi>Kent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The year following produc'd no Wars from the <hi>Saxons,</hi> ſo as <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius</hi> had leaſure to convert his Arms againſt the Author of all thoſe preſent miſeries, the unhappy King <hi>Vortigern:</hi> He marches therefore to the Caſtle <hi>Genorium,</hi> and Beſieges it, but found the King ſo ſtrongly For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified there, that by no force or cunning he could expugn it. At laſt by Fire, whether coming from Heaven, or caſt in by <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> is uncertain, both the King and his Caſtle were conſum'd, ſo as his Body was never after ſeen: <hi>Vortigern</hi> thus remov'd, the whole Power of the Kingdom was devolv'd upon <hi>Ambroſius</hi> by the Unanimous Conſent of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96414:61"/>
               <hi>For which purpoſe</hi> (ſaith Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,) a Council or Aſſembly was call'd about the Mountains of</hi> Erir <hi>in</hi> North-wales, <hi>by which he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to the Royal Dignity:</hi> In the year 465, or in the year following.</p>
            <p>How Happy this change was, will appear by what follows; for <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> as ſoon as he was plac'd in the Throne, imploy'd himſelf in repairing Churches, which had been ruin'd: He was indeed a Prince, Magnificent in his Gifts, Sedulous in the Worſhip of God, averſe from Flatteries, a Valiant Soldier, and very Skilful in Commanding an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and for theſe Virtues was famous in far diſtant Regions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo renown'd a Prince, he may poſſibly be the ſame <hi>Ambroſius</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by <hi>Eugypius</hi> in the Life of St. <hi>Severine,</hi> wherein he intimates, <hi>That the Holy Biſhop finding favour from</hi> Odoacer, <hi>whoſe Reign in</hi> Italy, <hi>he had fore-told, requeſted the King to free a perſon call'd</hi> Ambroſius <hi>from Baniſhment:</hi> And truly <hi>Baronius</hi> citing this paſſage, is of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; ſeveral years paſs'd after <hi>Ambroſius</hi> attain'd the Throne, either in Peace, or without any conſiderable War between the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Saxons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During this calm, St. <hi>Patrick</hi> who many years before return'd out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> dy'd in his Solitary retreat at <hi>Glaſtonbury;</hi> in the Antiquities whereof we may find, <hi>That after the Death of</hi> Vortigern, Aurelius Ambroſius <hi>raign'd; and then it was that St.</hi> Patrick <hi>the Apoſtle of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and firſt Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of</hi> Avallonia; <hi>after he inſtructed his Brethren in Regular Diſcipline, and competently enrich'd that Monaſtery with Poſſeſſions, procur'd from Kings and Princes, yielded to nature in the</hi> 39th. <hi>year after his return to that Iſland, and was buried in the Old Church on the Right-hand of the Altar, by direction of an Angel, a great flame in the ſight of all, breaking forth in the ſame place.</hi> The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Writers will needs have it, that St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Body repoſes in the Church of <hi>Down-Patrick</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> on whoſe ſide St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſeems to be, in his Life of St. <hi>Malachias,</hi> where he intimates, <hi>That St.</hi> Patrick<hi>'s Body reſts in the See of</hi> Armagh, <hi>accompanied with thoſe of St.</hi> Columbanus <hi>and St.</hi> Bridget: The difference may eaſily be decided, for no doubt but ſome conſiderable Relicks of his Sacred Body at the requeſt of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> have been depoſited at <hi>Down</hi> aforeſaid; a world of Examples of the like Errour being extant in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The ſpace of eight years being compleat after the Battle of <hi>Whippedsflet: Hengiſt</hi> took up Arms againſt the <hi>Britains,</hi> and once more diſcomfited them, carrying away immenſe Spoils: The Truth is, in theſe days ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the <hi>Britains,</hi> and ſometime their Enemies had the Victory, ſo that <hi>Hengiſt</hi> perceiving, that with thoſe Forces which he had, he could make little progreſs againſt ſo Valiant a Captain as <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> nor hardly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Provinces given to him by <hi>Vortigern,</hi> ſent for new and greater Supplies out of <hi>Germany;</hi> whereupon a famous <hi>Saxon</hi> call'd <hi>Ella</hi> with his three Sons <hi>Cymen, Pleting</hi> and <hi>Ciſſa,</hi> and a numerous Army took Sea, and by the direction of <hi>Hengiſt</hi> bent their courſe towards <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and landed at <hi>Cymen-Shore,</hi> ſo call'd from <hi>Ella</hi>'s Eldeſt Son.</p>
            <p>Now while the <hi>Saxons</hi> were landing, the <hi>Britains</hi> rais'd a loud Cry, at which a World of People repair'd to them from the places adjacent; and ſtraight a Combat began; the <hi>Saxons,</hi> men of great Stature and Courage receiv'd the <hi>Britains</hi> Politickly, and they as Imprudently ſet upon their Enemies; for coming in looſe Companies, one after another, they were eaſily ſlain by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who kept themſelves together in cloſe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96414:62"/>Bodies: So as the <hi>Britains,</hi> who ſtill came in to Aid their Country-men, were ſuddainly diſcourag'd, by the noiſe they heard of the formers Defeat. They were all therefore put to flight, as far as a Wood call'd <hi>Andredſleige,</hi> ſo as the <hi>Saxons</hi> poſſeſs'd themſelves of the Sea-coaſt of <hi>Suſsex,</hi> every day by little and little enlarging their limits, until the ninth year after their coming.</p>
            <p>In which ninth year, whilſt <hi>Ella</hi> and his company boldly enter'd further into the Country; the Princes and Nobles of the <hi>Britains</hi> met in Arms at a place call'd <hi>Mercredeburn,</hi> and Fought againſt the <hi>Saxons:</hi> The Victory was doubtful, for on both ſides the Armies were much impair'd and broken. So as each of them retir'd back to their own quarters; <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> ſaith, <hi>That</hi> Ella <hi>and his Sons were forc'd to forſake the Field; and fearing his ſtrength not enough, to make good his preſent Conqueſts, much leſs to enlarge them, ſent into</hi> Germany <hi>for new Supplies; which being arriv'd, he continu'd his Progreſs in gaining more Territories, 'till he eſtabliſh'd a new Kingdom of</hi> South-Saxons: Now while <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius</hi> imploy'd his Forces in repreſſing thoſe <hi>Southern-Saxons; Hengiſt</hi> having left his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Kent</hi> well guarded, took a Journey into the <hi>Northern</hi> Provinces, where joyning with the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> he took many Cities and Towns before the <hi>Britains</hi> could oppoſe him; and for Security of his Conqueſts, he built many Caſtles and Strong-holds, but demoliſh'd all Churches where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he came. King <hi>Ambroſius</hi> being inform'd hereof, with great Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as in Gods Cauſe, march'd after him, and beholding as he paſs'd on his Journey, the Towns laid waſte, and the lamentable ruines of the Churches, with the Miſeries of the poor People, he could not, as is ſaid, refrain from Weeping: Whereupon by Vow, <hi>He promis'd Almighty God, that if he Would render him Victorious over the</hi> Saxons, <hi>all the ruin'd Churches he would re-build and reſtore.</hi> How this Pious Vow was approv'd by God, let the ſucceſs demonſtrate; <hi>Ambroſius</hi> now reſolv'd to provoke the <hi>Saxons</hi> to a Combat, found <hi>Hengiſt</hi> with his Forces beyond <hi>Humber;</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſet upon the <hi>Britains</hi> in a Field call'd <hi>Maisbely,</hi> through which <hi>Ambroſius</hi> was to paſs, whom he hop'd to find unprovided: But the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> King had notice of this deſign, and prevented it: However the two Armies met in good order, and a fierce Battle began between them, much Blood was ſhed on both ſides: At laſt <hi>Hengiſt</hi> perceiving his Army to give ground, and the <hi>Britains</hi> to prevail, fled to a Town nam'd <hi>Cair-conan,</hi> now <hi>Cuningsbury;</hi> but conſidering the weakneſs of that Town, he betook himſelf to the Swords and Spears of his Soldiers, <hi>Ambroſius</hi> purſued him, and by the way put all the <hi>Saxons</hi> he found to the Sword; and having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a great Victory, gave devout Praiſe and Glory to the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: <hi>Hengiſt</hi> indeed Fortified his Camp the beſt he could near the ſaid Town, but in a few days, was forc'd to come to a Battle before his Camp, which prov'd fatal to him and his, for the greateſt part of his Army was cut in pieces, and himſelf taken Priſoner, and Beheaded by the <hi>Brittains.</hi> This Battle was Fought on the bank of the River <hi>Don.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manner how <hi>Hengiſt</hi> was taken, is thus related, <hi>The Valorous Duke or Conſul of</hi> Gloceſter, Eldoll, <hi>was very deſirous to cope with</hi> Hengiſt, <hi>and therefore with the Forces under his command furiouſly piercing into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Squadrons, found him at laſt, and laying hold on the fore-part of his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, with main force drew him within his own Troops; ſaying,</hi> God hath at laſt fulfill'd my deſire; He it is who hath given us the Victory: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96414:62"/>the</hi> Saxons <hi>fled,</hi> Octa <hi>the Son of</hi> Hengiſt, <hi>to</hi> York; Eſca, <hi>and not a few with him, betook themſelves to the City of</hi> Acluid: <hi>After this Victory</hi> Ambroſius <hi>took the City</hi> Caerconan, <hi>which he enter'd Triumphantly: Then</hi> Ambroſius <hi>calling his Captains together, commanded them to Decree what ſhould become of</hi> Hengiſt; <hi>whereupon</hi> Eldad <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Gloceſter <hi>and Brother of</hi> Eldol, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Silence on them all, and gnaſhing his Teeth for rage, told them,</hi> Though all there preſent, had a deſire to ſet him free, I my ſelf would cut him in pieces: Why (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) do you delay, O Effeminate <hi>Britains;</hi> did not <hi>Samuel</hi> a Prophet having taken the King of <hi>Amalec</hi> Priſoner in Battle, cut him in pieces, one Limb after another, ſaying, <hi>As thou haſt made many Mothers Childleſs, ſo will I make thy Mother Childleſs this day:</hi> Do you therefore deal in the ſame manner with this Barbarous King, who is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Agag,</hi> and hath depriv'd a world of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Mothers of their Children. <hi>When</hi> Eldad <hi>had thus ſaid, He drew his Sword, and leading</hi> Hengiſt <hi>out of the City, cut off his Head, ſending his wretched Soul to Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether this Speech or Action became a Chriſtian Biſhop, I muſt leave to Graver Judgments: <hi>Ambroſius</hi> thus Triumphing, was not unmindful of his Vow, but took care to repair the Houſes of God, which had been lately deſtroy'd, and placing in them Prieſts and other Clergy-men, he reduc'd the Divine Service to its Priſtine order; and where ever he found any Idols or Temples of Falſe Gods, he defac'd them utterly out of the memory of men He Studiouſly obſerv'd Juſtice and Peace, eſpecially as to Eccleſiaſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, on whom he liberally confer'd Revenues, injoyning them to Pray for the King, and ſtate of Gods Church. <hi>Hengiſt</hi> thus dead, his Son <hi>Aeſca,</hi> by <hi>Bede,</hi> nam'd <hi>Oiſc,</hi> ſucceeded in the Kingdom of <hi>Kent,</hi> and from him, his Succeſſors were call'd <hi>Oiſckings:</hi> what became of his Brother <hi>Otta,</hi> who was ſaid to fly to <hi>York,</hi> can no where be found in any Antient Writer, and therefore little Credit is to be given to what is reported of him by ſome late Writers; That <hi>Ambroſius</hi> ſhould beſtow upon him the Province of <hi>Galloway</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was not in his diſpoſal.</p>
            <p>The ſame year wherein <hi>Hengiſt</hi> was ſlain, the Holy Virgin St. <hi>Bridget</hi> came out of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> to obtain ſome Relicks of her Dear and Honour'd Patron St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> whoſe Diſciple ſhe had been, and a great admirer of his Sanctity: She ſtay'd here ſome years in a ſmall Iſland near <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> call'd <hi>Bekery,</hi> where was an Oratory Conſecrated to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> afterward, leaving behind her <hi>Scrip Chain Bell,</hi> and other Veſtments of her own wearing, which for the memory of her Sanctity were there repos'd; ſhe return'd to <hi>Ireland;</hi> where, not long after ſhe reſted in our Lord, and was Buried in the City of <hi>Down:</hi> Concerning her we may thus read in the <hi>Martyrologies, This day (the firſt of</hi> February) <hi>is Celebrated the memory of the Bleſsed Virgin St.</hi> Bridget, <hi>who in Teſtimony of her Virginity, having touch'd the Wood of an Altar, it became preſently green.</hi> She is ſaid to have out-liv'd St. <hi>Patrick</hi> only 30 years.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Engliſh Martyrology</hi> there is a Commemoration of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, call'd St. <hi>Sophias,</hi> whoſe death is aſſign'd to the 490 year of our Lord, He was the Son of <hi>Guilleicus,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Ordovices</hi> or <hi>North-Wales,</hi> and undertook a Monaſtical Profeſſion in a Monaſtery Built by himſelf in the ſame Province: He had ſuch Devotion to our Lords Paſſion, that he made three Pilgrimages to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to viſit the Marks and Foot-ſteps of it: A great Veneration alſo he had for <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe places which had been Conſecrated by the Blood of the two Princes of the Apoſtles. Being
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96414:63"/>at <hi>Rome,</hi> he was by the Biſhop thereof, Conſecrated Biſhop of <hi>Beneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> which See he govern'd with Prudence and Sanctity, till at laſt he was ſlain by an Impious <hi>Pagan,</hi> at the Holy Altar, while he was Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Myſtery of our Redemption.</p>
            <p>No leſs famous at this time was the Holy <hi>Britiſh</hi> Virgin St. <hi>Keyna;</hi> Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious ſhe was for her Birth, being the Daughter of <hi>Braganus,</hi> Prince of that Province in <hi>Wales,</hi> which from him was call'd <hi>Brecknokſhire;</hi> but more Illuſtrious for her Zeal to preſerve her Chaſtity, for which ſhe was call'd in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Tongue <hi>Keynvayre,</hi> that is, <hi>Keyna</hi> the Virgin: This Prince <hi>Braganus,</hi> or <hi>Brachanus,</hi> is ſaid to have had twelve Sons, and as many Daughters by his Lady call'd <hi>Macella</hi> Daughter of <hi>Theodoric</hi> Son of <hi>Tethphalt</hi> Prince of <hi>Garthmatrin,</hi> afterward nam'd <hi>Brecknock;</hi> their firſt born Son was St. <hi>Canoc,</hi> of whom more hereafter; their eldeſt Daughter was <hi>Gladus,</hi> Mother of <hi>Cadocus</hi> by St. <hi>Gunley</hi> a Holy King of the <hi>Southern Britains;</hi> their ſecond Daughter was <hi>Melaria</hi> or <hi>Nonita,</hi> the Mother of the Holy Archbiſhop St. <hi>David;</hi> mention will be made hereafter of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medha</hi> another of their Daughters: As for St. <hi>Keyna,</hi> when ſhe came to ripe years, many Noble perſons ſought her in Marriage, but ſhe utterly refus'd that ſtate, having Conſecrated her Virginity to our Lord by a perpetual Vow; at length ſhe determin'd to forſake her Country, and find out ſome Deſert place where ſhe might attend to Contemplation; wherefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting her Journey beyond <hi>Severn,</hi> and coming to certain Woody places; <hi>She requeſted the Prince of that Country, that ſhe might be permitted to ſerve God in that Solitude:</hi> The Prince was willing to grant her requeſt, only he told her, <hi>The place did ſo ſwarm with Serpents, that neither Men nor Beaſts could inhabit in it;</hi> To which ſhe reply'd, <hi>That her Truſt was fix'd in the Name and Aſſiſtance of Almighty God, and therefore ſhe doubted not to drive all that Poiſonous brood out of that Region:</hi> Hereupon the place was readily granted to the Holy Virgin, who proſtrating her ſelf to God in fervent Prayer, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd of him to change all the Serpents and Vipers there into Stones; ſo as to this day the Stones in that Region, reſemble the Windings of Serpents, through all the Fields and Villages; as if they had been ſo fram'd by the Hand of the Engraver: <hi>Cambden</hi> gives ſome account of this Miracle: <hi>On the</hi> Weſtern <hi>Banks of</hi> Avon (ſaith he) <hi>is ſeen the Town of</hi> Cainſham, <hi>ſome are of Opinion that it was nam'd ſo, from</hi> Keyna, <hi>a moſt Holy</hi> Britiſh <hi>Virgin; who according to the Credulous perſwaſion of former Ages, is believ'd to have turn'd Serpents into Stones, for that ſuch like Miracles of ſporting Nature, are there ſometimes found in the Quarries. I my ſelf</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſaw a Stone brought from thence repreſenting a Serpent roll'd up into a Spire: The Head of it ſtuck out in the outward Surface, and the end of the Tayl terminated in the Center.</hi> Many years having been ſpent by this Holy Virgin in this Solitary place, and the fame of her Sanctity every where divulg'd, many Oratories alſo built by her; her Nephew St. <hi>Cadoc</hi> performing a Pilgrimage to the Mount of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> met there with his Bleſſed Aunt St. <hi>Keyna</hi> to his great joy, and would have had her back to her own Country; but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of that Region would not permit it.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, afterwards by the Admonition of an Angel, the Holy Maid return'd to the place of her Nativity; where on the Top of a Hillock, ſeated at the foot of a high Mountain, ſhe made a little Habitation for her ſelf; and by her Prayers to God, obtain'd a Spring there out of the Earth; which by the Merits of the Holy Virgin afforded help in divers Infirmities.

               <hi>One night when the time of her Conſummation approach'd, by the Revelation of the Holy Ghoſt, ſhe ſaw in a Viſion, as it were a Fiery Pillar, the Baſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was fix'd in her Bed, which was no other then a Pavement ſtrew'd over with a few Branches of Trees. In this Viſion two Angels appear'd to her, one of which approaching reſpectfully to her, ſeem'd to take off the Sack-cloath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe was cover'd, and inſtead thereof, to put on her a Smock of Fine-linnen, over that a Tunick of Purple; and laſt of all a Mantle all woven with Gold, and then bid her prepare her ſelf to come with them, that they might lead her into her Heavenly Fathers Kingdom.</hi> Hereupon ſhe wept with exceſſive joy, and endeavouring to follow the Angels, awak'd, and found her Body inflam'd with a Feaver, by which ſhe perceiv'd her end was near: Sending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for her Nephew St. <hi>Cadoc,</hi> ſhe ſaid thus to him; <hi>This is the place above all others belov'd by me, here my memory ſhall be perpetuated: This place I will often viſit in Spirit, if it may be, and I am ſure it ſhall be permitted; for our Lord hath granted me this place as an Inheritance: The time will come when this place ſhall be inhabited by a ſinful People, which notwithſtanding, I will vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently root out of this ſeat. My Tomb ſhall lye a long time unknown, 'till the coming of other People, whom by my Prayers I ſhall bring hither; them will I protect and defend, and the Name of our Lord ſhall in this place be Bleſſed for ever.</hi> After this, her Soul being ready to depart out of her Body, ſhe ſaw ſtanding before her, a Troop of Heavenly Angels, ready with joy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her Soul, and to tranſport it ſafe from her Spiritual Enemies: She had no ſooner related this Comfortable Viſion to the ſtanders by, but her Bleſſed Soul was freed from the Priſon of her Body: In this her Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion her face ſmil'd, and was all of a Roſy colour; and from her Sacred Virgin Body, ſo ſweet a Fragrancy proceeded, that thoſe who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thought themſelves in the joys of Paradice: St. <hi>Cadocus</hi> Buried her in her own Country, where for many years, ſhe had led a moſt Holy Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Life, very acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>To the Geſts of this Holy Virgin St. <hi>Keyna,</hi> we may here adjoyn what is reported of her Siſter <hi>Almedha,</hi> and her Brother St. <hi>Cadocus:</hi> Many Churches are diſpers'd through ſeveral Provinces of <hi>Cambria,</hi> Illuſtrated by the Names of the Children of <hi>Braganus;</hi> of theſe, one is ſeated in the top of a certain Hill in the Region of <hi>Brecknock,</hi> not far diſtant from the principal Caſtle of <hi>Aberhoden,</hi> which is call'd the Church of St. <hi>Almedha;</hi> who rejecting the Marriage of an Earthly Prince, and Eſpouſing her ſelf to the Eternal King, Conſummated her Life by a Triumphant Martyrdom: The place of her Solemnity, is yearly Celebrated the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> whereto great numbers of Devout People from far diſtant parts, us'd to Aſſemble, and by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of that Holy Virgin, receive their deſir'd Health from divers Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: One ſpecial thing hap'ning uſually in the Solemnity of this Bleſſed Virgin, ſeems very remarkable: <hi>For you may there often-times ſee Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Maids ſometimes in the Church, ſometimes in the Church-yard, and ſometimes while they are Dancing in an even ground encompaſſing it, to fall down on a ſuddain to the ground; at firſt they lye quiet, as if they were wrap'd in an Extaſie; but preſently they will leap up, as if poſſeſs'd with a Frenzy, and with both their Hands and Feet before the People, they will repreſent what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Servile work, they unlawfully perform'd upon Feaſt days of the Church; one will walk as if holding the Plow, another as if driving Oxen with a Goad, and both of them in the mean time Singing ſome rude Tune, as if to eaſe their Toyl; one will act the Trade of a Shooe-maker, another of a Tanner; a third, of one
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96414:64"/>which were Spinning: Here you may ſee a Maid buſily Weaving, and expreſſing all the Poſtures uſual in that work: After all which being brought with Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the Altar, you would be aſtoniſh'd to ſee how ſuddenly they will return to their Senſes again.</hi> Hereby, through Gods Mercy, who rejoyceth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Converſion, then Deſtruction of ſinners; it is certain, that very many have been corrected and induc'd to obſerve the Holy Feaſts with great Devotion.</p>
            <p>Touching their Brother <hi>Cadoc,</hi> the Fame of his Sanctity was moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent among the <hi>Silures,</hi> his Name is conſign'd in our <hi>Engliſh Martyrology,</hi> on the 11th. of <hi>February;</hi> and that he flouriſh'd in all Virtues in the year of Chriſt 492. To him in all probability is to be refer'd that which is reported of the Wreath <hi>(Torquis)</hi> of St. <hi>Canauc:</hi> The Inhabitants of that Country eſteem this Wreath, to be a precious Relick, and of wonderful Virtue; inſomuch, <hi>As when any one is to give a Teſtimony by Oath, if that Wreath be placed in ſight, he dares not preſume to commit Perjury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſame year mention is made of the Martyrdom of a King of <hi>Breck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock,</hi> call'd <hi>Clitanc,</hi> or <hi>Clintanc,</hi> a Prince very obſervant of Peace and Juſtice among his Subjects; who became a Martyr adorn'd with a Caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Crown, for his Virtues and Merits, eſpecially his Chaſtity and Purity from Carnal Delectations.</p>
            <p>In the year 491. is moſt aptly placed the beginning of the Kingdom of the <hi>South-Saxons;</hi> which as it began more early than moſt of the reſt, ſo did it ſooneſt fail, and was the laſt that embrac'd the Chriſtian Faith: <hi>Ella</hi> had a long time held the Kingdom of <hi>Suſſex</hi> in great Power: He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd great Recruits out of <hi>Germany;</hi> ſo that being conſident of his Forces, in the third year after the death of <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> he laid Siege to the City of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredeceſter;</hi> the <hi>Britains</hi> gather'd infinite numbers to raiſe this Siege, and both day and night, vex'd the Beſiegers with Ambuſhes and Incurſions; but they, nothing diſcourag'd, gave continual Aſſaults on the City, and in every Aſſault the <hi>Britains</hi> ſet on their backs, throwing Arrows and Darts upon them, ſo as they were forc'd to give over the Aſſault, and turn their Forces againſt the <hi>Britains,</hi> who being more nimble, quickly run into the Woods; and when the <hi>Saxons</hi> return to the Walls, they alſo return upon their backs: By this means the <hi>Saxons</hi> were extreamly Harraſs'd, and great ſlaughters made of them; till at laſt the <hi>Saxons</hi> were compell'd to divide their Army into two parts, and to imploy one part in expugning the City, while the other was in readineſs to Fight with the <hi>Britains</hi> from without: Then indeed the Beſieged weak'ned with Famine, could no longer reſiſt the <hi>Saxons,</hi> by whom they were all conſum'd with the Sword; moreover, in revenge of the great loſſes ſuſtain'd by the <hi>Saxons</hi> during this Siege, they demoliſh'd the City, ſo as it was never built again: There only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the mark of a place where once a Noble City had been ſeated. We find mention made of a Provoſt of a Company of Soldiers under the Count of the <hi>Saxon</hi>-ſhore, placed at <hi>Anderida,</hi> as the <hi>Romans</hi> call'd it, to defend the Coaſts from <hi>Saxon</hi> Rovers: There is left now no foot-ſteps of this great City, only a great Forreſt, call'd by the <hi>Saxons Andraedwald,</hi> and by the <hi>Britains</hi> Lord <hi>Andred;</hi> which being Antently ſeated near where the ſaid City of <hi>Anderida</hi> ſtood, continues the name of it.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Ambroſius</hi> is ſaid to have come to the Mount of <hi>Ambri,</hi> near <hi>Caer Carec,</hi> now <hi>Salisbury,</hi> where <hi>Hengiſt</hi> Treacherouſly ſlaughter'd ſo many Princes, for whom he intended to raiſe a Famous Monument. There
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96414:64"/>alſo he is ſaid to have conſtituted two Metropolitans, St. <hi>Sampſon</hi> at <hi>York,</hi> and St. <hi>Dubritius</hi> at <hi>Caerleon.</hi> The ſecond year after the Erection of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>South-Saxons,</hi> was Illuſtrious for a great Victory obtain'd by the <hi>Britains</hi> againſt the <hi>Saxons</hi> at the <hi>Hill Badonicus,</hi> as <hi>Bede</hi> writes, <hi>The</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>conducted by their famous King</hi> Ambroſius, <hi>took Courage, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Victorious</hi> Saxons <hi>to Combat, by the Divine Favour, obtain'd a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over them; after which ſometimes the</hi> Britains, <hi>ſometimes the</hi> Saxons <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd, until the</hi> Saxons <hi>were Beſieged in the Mountain</hi> Badonicus, <hi>and a great ſlaughter was made of them: Polydore Virgil</hi> will have this mountain between <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> and the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham;</hi> but <hi>Cambden</hi> with greater probability, makes the Territory of the Antient City of <hi>Bath,</hi> the Scene of this Battle and Victory. By the <hi>Britains</hi> it was call'd <hi>Caer Badon: The City</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was Beſieged by the</hi> Saxons, <hi>but by the coming of the War-like Prince</hi> Arthur, <hi>they were forc'd to retire to the Mountain</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donicus, <hi>where, after a long and deſperate Fight, they were overcome, and great numbers of them ſlain: This Mountain ſeems to be that which is now call'd</hi> Banneſdown, <hi>at the foot whereof is ſeated a little Village, call'd</hi> Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, <hi>where to this day are ſeen Rampires and Trenches, the marks of a Camp.</hi> This Victory is principally to be aſcrib'd to <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> under whom the ſaid <hi>Arthur</hi> his Nephew, Son to his Brother <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terpendragon,</hi> was indeed a principal Officer, and is ſaid often to have repreſs'd the Haughty <hi>Saxons,</hi> ſwelling with the Pride of their Conqueſts. This is that <hi>Arthur,</hi> of whom the <hi>Britains,</hi> have wrote ſo many triſſing Fables: A Prince worthy to be magnified by the Truth of Hiſtory, and not to be made the ſubject of idle Dreams; ſince by his own admirable Courage he ſuſtain'd his declining Country, and incited the Heartleſs <hi>Britains</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume their Courage.</p>
            <p>One thing is remarkable in this Prince, that in the Siege of this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Badonicus;</hi> confiding in the Protection of our Bleſſed Lady, whoſe Image he carried Sow'd to his Arms, he put to flight and ſlew 900 <hi>Saxons:</hi> His cuſtom was to make uſe of theſe Spiritual Arms; and as <hi>Huntingdon</hi> affirms, <hi>In a Combat near the Caſtle of</hi> Guinton, <hi>he carried the ſame Image on his Shoulders, and by the power of our Lord Jeſus and his Holy Mother</hi> Mary, <hi>that whole day the</hi> Saxons <hi>fled before him. Florilegus</hi> writes, <hi>That Prince</hi> Arthur<hi>'s Shield, on which the Image of our Lady was Painted, was named</hi> Pridwen; <hi>and that in a certain Battle, he drawing ferth his Sword,</hi> Caliburn, <hi>invok'd the Name of the Bleſsed Virgin, and with great Violence peircing into the midſt of the Enemies, at one Blow he ſlew whomſoever he touch'd with it; nor gave he over, till he had ſlain</hi> 840. <hi>of his Enemies with his Sword alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time there was a wonderful Apparition of the Glorious Arch-Angel St. <hi>Michael</hi> on the Mountain <hi>Garganus</hi> in <hi>Calabria,</hi> the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whereof is Celebrated Anniverſarily by the Catholick Church on the 8th. of <hi>May:</hi> We here make mention of it, becauſe a Holy Biſhop born in this Iſland of <hi>Saxon</hi> Parents, St. <hi>Richard</hi> by Name, was preſent at the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of a Church built in memory of this Apparition: This Biſhop was the firſt of the <hi>Angli</hi> or <hi>Saxons</hi> recorded in Eccleſiaſtical Monuments, to have been gain'd to Chriſt, ſoon after their entrance into <hi>Britain,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any open Hoſtility broke forth between the Nations: He was born of Illuſtrious Parents, and in the year of Grace 455. his Innocence and Piety appear'd in his tender years, and in that Age he was averſe from Luxury
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96414:65"/>and Wantonneſs, diligent in reading the Scriptures, converſing chiefly with men of Learning and Virtue; by which he not only gain'd Love from his Parents, but Veneration from his Companions and Strangers: But becauſe the following War; and the Idolatrous Rites of his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, furious Enemies of that Religion, to which our Lord had call'd him, were a hindrance to his Progreſs in Piety: While he was intent upon his Devotions, the Glorious Apoſtle St <hi>Peter</hi> appear'd to him in his ſleep, commanding him, in the Name of Almighty God, <hi>To take a Journey into</hi> Apulia, <hi>there to Preach the word of God to the</hi> Andrians; <hi>and that he ſhould not apprehend the length of the way or menaces of the Infidels, becauſe our Lord would be preſent to aſſiſt him:</hi> St. <hi>Richard</hi> thus awak'd from ſleep, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately roſe, and caſting himſelf before a Crucifix, gave humble thanks to God, and St. <hi>Peter</hi> for this Viſitation: The day following, he forſook his Brethren, and taking his leave of his Deareſt Friends; notwithſtanding their importunity to detain him, began his Journey; and being arriv'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> he addreſs'd himſelf to the Holy Pope <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> and declar'd what had been in his Viſion impos'd upon him by the Holy Apoſtle; begging his Permiſſion and Bleſſing, to go for <hi>Andria,</hi> there to fulfil his Miniſtry: <hi>Gelaſius</hi> hearing this, greatly rejoyc'd, and obſerving the Venerable Aſpect of St. <hi>Richard,</hi> with his Gravity, ordain'd him Biſhop of <hi>Andria;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him whereſoever he went, to Preach the Goſpel of Chriſt; and and ſo Kiſſing him, gave him his Benediction. St. <hi>Richard</hi> accordingly throughout his Journey Preached the Word of God, and by many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Cures of the Sick, Converted many to the Faith and Worſhip of God. At length he arriv'd at <hi>Andria,</hi> where, before the Gate of the City he ſaw a Blind-man, and a Woman, Bowed, and Contracted together, both which beg'd an Alms of him. He began to expound the Word of God to them, and perceiving the Blind man Attentive to him, he ſaid, <hi>If thou wilt believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and be Baptiz'd, thou ſhalt receive thy ſight;</hi> The Blind man anſwer'd, <hi>I believe in Jeſus Chriſt whom thou Preacheſt, and beg that I may be Baptiz'd:</hi> Whereupon the Holy man, with his Hands making the Sign of the Croſs upon the Blind-man's Eyes, he immediately receiv'd his Sight: And caſting away the Staves which had help'd him in walking, he gave Thanks to God and St. <hi>Richard,</hi> by whom he had been Enlightned. As for the Woman, when ſhe ſaw the Miracle, ſhe likewiſe was Cnoverted; ſo as St. <hi>Richard</hi> perceiving her Faith, took her by the Hand; whereupon ſhe roſe up ſtreight, and walking, cry'd out with a loud voice, <hi>There is only one moſt high God, who by his good Servant hath made me whole:</hi> At theſe Acclamations of the Woman, the greateſt part of the City met together, and attending to the Holy Biſhops Preaching, were in ſhort time Converted; God by him working many Miracles; ſo as the ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, having broken down all their Idols, were Baptiz'd by him.</p>
            <p>Not long after which, follow'd the Apparition of St. <hi>Michael</hi> to the People of <hi>Siponto,</hi> who commanded them to Erect a Chappel there to his Name: This they ſignified to their Biſhop <hi>Laurentius,</hi> and He to <hi>Pope Gelaſius,</hi> deſiring his advice, what was to be done; His Anſwer was, <hi>That being will'd by the Bleſſed Arch-Angel, a Church ſhould forthwith be built, and that it ſhould be perform'd by the Holy Biſhops</hi> Laurentius <hi>of</hi> Siponto, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus <hi>of</hi> Cannuſium, Pelagius <hi>of</hi> Salapia, Roger <hi>of</hi> Caunae <hi>and</hi> Richard <hi>of</hi> Andria. Upon this the two Holy Biſhops laſt mention'd, took their Journey to <hi>Siponto</hi> on foot, with daily Faſting, toylſom Labours, and incommodity
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96414:65"/>from the burning heat of the <hi>Sun;</hi> which incommodity, upon their Prayers, was miraculouſly remedied, by the flying of a mighty Eagle over their Heads, which ſhadow'd them during their whole Journey: At their Arrival they perform'd what they came for, as we may read in the publick Office of that Church: The Death of this Holy Biſhop is Commemorated in the <hi>Martyrology</hi> yearly on the 9th. of <hi>April.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year of Grace 494. A third Noble <hi>German</hi> came into <hi>Britain,</hi> Nam'd <hi>Cerdic,</hi> a man of a High Spirit and Noble Deſcent, as proceeding from the Stock of <hi>Woden:</hi> Hearing of two Kingdoms already Erected in <hi>Britain;</hi> he reſolv'd to venture for a ſhare in his Country-mens Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For that purpoſe, with his Son <hi>Cenric,</hi> and five Ships, he land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a place after call'd <hi>Cerdic-ſhore,</hi> and the ſame day was met by multitudes of <hi>Britains,</hi> who Fought with him: The <hi>Saxons</hi> having rang'd their Forces in order, ſtood immoveable before their Ships: The <hi>Britains</hi> boldly ſet upon them, and then retir'd, but were not purſu'd by the Enemy; for they were reſolv'd not to quit their place: The Fight continu'd, the <hi>Britains</hi> ſometimes Charging, then retiring, 'till night ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd them; and after the <hi>Britains</hi> perceiving the fierceneſs of thoſe new come Strangers, departed; yet ſo, that neither ſide could boaſt of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; only this advantage the <hi>Saxons</hi> had, that they took poſſeſſion of their Enemies Shore, and by little and little enlarg'd their Conqueſts along the Sea Coaſts: Their landing was in the Province of the <hi>Iceni,</hi> comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Norfolk;</hi> but there they ſettled not, for marching through the Iſland, they came into the <hi>Weſtern</hi> parts, where, in time they Erected the new and Powerful Kingdom of the <hi>Weſt Saxons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Iſland thus diſmembred by Barbarous Enemies; yet ſuſtain'd greater Damage by Civil Diſſentions, rais'd by <hi>Paſcentius</hi> a Son of the late King <hi>Vortigern,</hi> who, after the Death of his Father, perceiving the Minds of the <hi>Britains</hi> inclin'd to <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> fled into <hi>Germany;</hi> where he remain'd ſeveral years, endeavouring to gather Forces ſufficient to reſtore him to the Throne of his Anceſtors; at length about the year 496. he came with a Powerful and well furniſh'd Army, and landed in the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of the Iſland, with intent to revenge his own and his Fathers injuries upon <hi>Ambroſius.</hi> Upon news hereof, <hi>Ambroſius</hi> marches ſpeedily to meet him, they came to a Battle, wherein <hi>Paſcentius</hi> was overcome and forc'd to fly into the Country of the <hi>Scots,</hi> where, he recruited his Army, and return'd once more to try his Fortune againſt the <hi>Britains.</hi> But hearing that <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſius</hi> lay ſick at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> he thought it better to work his revenge by Treaſon, then open force: Therefore by Gifts and Promiſes he hir'd a certain <hi>Saxon</hi> call'd <hi>Eopa,</hi> to fain himſelf a <hi>Phyſitian</hi> and a <hi>Britain;</hi> who under this feign'd ſhew, and with a pretence of great Piety and Affection to the King, being admitted, mingled Poiſon in a Potion adminiſtred to him, of which <hi>Ambroſius</hi> preſently dy'd, in the 31th. year of his Reign; But <hi>Paſcentius</hi> did not long enjoy the fruits of his Treaſon: For <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragon,</hi> Brother to the dead <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> and General of his Armies, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt <hi>Paſcentius,</hi> obtain'd a Signal Victory againſt him, and in a Battle ſlew him and his Captains that came with him.</p>
            <p>The year following <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ter</hi> came to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and calling an Aſſembly of the Clergy and People of the Kingdom, took upon him the Crown of <hi>Britain,</hi> which is ſaid to have been ſet upon his Head by the Holy Biſhop <hi>Dubritius. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ter</hi> then calling to mind a great <hi>Comet</hi> which had appear'd the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96414:66"/>year before, darting ſorth only one Beam, at the end whereof was ſeen a Globe of Fire, ſhap'd like a Dragon; out of whoſe Mouth proceeded two Beams, one reaching to <hi>Gaul,</hi> and the other ſhooting towards <hi>Ireland,</hi> which ended in ſeven leſs Beams: For this reaſon he commanded two Dragons to be made of Gold like to that which had appear'd; one of them he gave in Oblation to the Church in <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> the other he carried with him, placing it in every Combat in his Enſign; and from that time he was call'd in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Language <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>therpendragon:</hi> And hence it is, that to this day our Kings, in their War-like Expeditions, carry the like Enſign. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ter</hi> had no ſooner put on his Crown, but he was forc'd to exchange it for a Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece; for <hi>Eſca</hi> the Succeſſor of <hi>Hengiſt</hi> and his Son <hi>Octa,</hi> attended with a mighty Army of <hi>Saxons,</hi> Invaded the <hi>Northern</hi> Provinces of <hi>Britain,</hi> and deſtroy'd all the Munitions between <hi>Albany</hi> and <hi>York.</hi> At laſt when they attempted the Siege of the City of <hi>Alcluid, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terpendragon</hi> came upon them with all the ſtrength of the Country, and enter'd Battle againſt them. The <hi>Saxons</hi> manfully reſiſted, and in the end compell'd the <hi>Britains</hi> to fly as far as a Mountain call'd <hi>Danet,</hi> which they ſeiz'd upon as a place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge; being ſo diſmay'd, that they ſcarce knew what they did, but at laſt they reſolv'd upon a prudent Exploit, which was, Courageouſly to ſet upon the Enemies by night: This Deſign they executed Proſperouſly, for the <hi>Saxons</hi> being thus unexpectedly invaded, ſcarce endur'd any Combat at all, but were utterly routed, and <hi>Eſca</hi> and <hi>Octa</hi> were taken Priſoners, whom the King carried with him to <hi>London,</hi> where he caus'd them to be kept ſafe: About this time <hi>Arthur</hi> became of ripe Age.</p>
            <p>The year of Grace 500. in our Eccleſiaſtical Monuments, is remarkable for the Death of St. <hi>Cadoc</hi> the Holy Abbot, Son of <hi>Gunleus</hi> Prince of the <hi>Southern Britains,</hi> and <hi>Gladus</hi> Daughter of <hi>Braghan:</hi> The Father of St. <hi>Cadoc, Gunleus</hi> by Divine Vocation growing weary of the World, built a Church, where he began to live in great Abſtinence and Purity of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: His Cloathing was Sack-cloath, his Diet Barley-Bread mingled with Aſhes, and his Drink Water, he uſually roſe at mid-night, and to abate Carnal Deſires, caſt himſelf into Cold-water; He received nothing from any, but ſuſtain'd himſelf with the Labour of his Hands. This retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of St. <hi>Cadoc</hi>'s Father, began while he was a Child, who when he came to years of Diſcretion, choſe rather to imitate his Fathers Devotion, then to be expos'd to the Temptations and Viciſſitudes of the World in the enjoyment of his Principality: He had for his Maſter and Director in the way of Piety, a Learn'd and Holy man, famous in that Age, call'd <hi>Tathai,</hi> who liv'd a Solitary Life, in all Auſterity among the mountains of <hi>South-wales,</hi> 'till he was invited by <hi>Caradoc</hi> Prince of that Province to live Coenobitically, and to inſtitute young-men in Learning and Piety, at a City call'd <hi>Venta Silurum</hi> in the Province of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> which Region from that City was by the <hi>Britains</hi> call'd <hi>Guent,</hi> the City being then an Academy Dedicated to the Studies of Literature, over which St. <hi>Tathai</hi> was Preſident; and exerciſing that Office with great commendation, built there a Church,: Under ſo worthy a Maſter, St. <hi>Cadoc</hi> made wonderful Progreſs in Virtue and Piety, and himſelf became a Guide in Spiritual Life, and a Father of the Monks: For that purpoſe he built a Monaſtery, which was call'd <hi>Lancarvan,</hi> from an admirable accident in the building of it, wherein this Holy Father imploy'd wilde Harts, which became familiar, obedient and ſerviceable to him: Thus both the Father and the Son con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning

            <p>As from <hi>Ireland</hi> many Holy men ſought a retreat for their Devotion in <hi>Britain;</hi> ſo in theſe tumultuous times upon the ſame motive, ſome were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to retire out of <hi>Britain</hi> into <hi>Ireland:</hi> Biſhop <hi>

Saint <hi>Petroc</hi> was by Nation a <hi>Cambrian,</hi> not a <hi>Cimbrian,</hi> as in the <hi>Gallican Martyrology</hi> is miſtaken, born of Princely Parents in <hi>Wales,</hi> and in his Infancy did ſo well imitate the Faith and Virtues of St. <hi>Peter</hi> Prince of the Apoſtles, that his Name may ſeem to have been given him by Divine Inſpiration, as if God had deſtin'd him to be a Rock on which the Church of <hi>Britain</hi> ſhould be built. When the Prince his Father was dead, the Nobles of the Country, with the conſent of the whole People, were deſirous he ſhould ſucceed in the Royalty: But he neglecting world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pomp, aſſum'd with him 60 Companions, and with them enter'd into a Monaſtery, and there undertook a Monaſtical Profeſſion: After ſome time there ſpent, he went into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where for the ſpace of 20 years, he addicted himſelf to the Study of good Learning and the Holy Scriptures; great part of which time St. <hi>Coemegen</hi> was under his Tuition. Now having in this ſpace of time heap'd up a great Treaſure of Learning, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt perfect Teachers of that Iſland, he return'd into <hi>Britain,</hi> and in the Province of <hi>Corinia</hi> or <hi>Cornwall,</hi> intended to imploy all that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for the Benefit of others. And to ſhew that he had not deſerted his Religious Profeſſion, he built a Monaſtery in a Town toward the <hi>Severn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,</hi> in thoſe days call'd <hi>Loderic</hi> and <hi>Laffenac;</hi> afterwards from him, <hi>Petrocſtow,</hi> now more contractedly <hi>Padſtow:</hi> At this time the <hi>Saxons</hi> under <hi>Cerdic</hi> had poſſeſs'd themſelves of that Province, and when the Saint with his Diſciples had landed and left their Ship, certain Reapers then at work, ſpoke rudely and bitterly to them; and among other taunting Speeches, requir'd them, <hi>That their Conductor St.</hi> Petroc, <hi>ſhould for the aſſwaging of their Thirſt, cauſe a Spring of freſh Water to iſſue out of a Rock there ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning.</hi> This was ſaid either in Deriſion of them, being Strangers, or for a Tryal, whether their Sanctity was anſwerable to their Profeſſion: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon St. <hi>Petroc,</hi> who never refus'd what was in his Power, addreſs'd his Prayers to our Merciful Lord, and with his Staff ſmiting the Rock, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly there guſh'd forth a Spring of clear ſweet water, which is ſaid to flow there at this day: The Barbarous <hi>Pagans</hi> utterly ignorant of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, were aſtoniſh'd at this Miracle. And when the Holy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God ask'd them, <hi>Whether there were any in that Province, who Profeſs'd the Chriſtian Faith,</hi> They directed him to a Holy man call'd <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſon, Who,</hi> they told him, <hi>led a Solitary Life, and exercis'd himſelf in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Labours, Faſting, Watching and Prayers, ſuſtaining himſelf daily with a ſmall Portion of Barly Bread,</hi> This is that <hi>Samſon,</hi> who ſucceeded St. <hi>David</hi> in the See of <hi>Menevia,</hi> and after was Biſhop of <hi>Dole</hi> in leſſer <hi>Britain,</hi> of whom more hereafter.</p>

            <p>All Authors agree, that the year 508. was fatal to the <hi>Britains</hi> for the loſs of a great Battle; wherein either their Valiant King, or General of his Army was ſlain; The Name of the Party mention'd to be ſlain, makes the confuſion. The Noble Hiſtorian <hi>Ethelward</hi> expreſly affirms, <hi>That</hi> Cerdic <hi>and his Son</hi> Cenric <hi>ſlew</hi> Natanleod <hi>King of the</hi> Britains. <hi>Mat.

Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntingdon</hi> thus deſcribes this Battle; Nazaleod (ſaith he, ſo he calls <hi>Natanleod,</hi>) <hi>was a Prince of great Fame, and withall of great Pride, of whom the Province was call'd</hi> Nazaleoli, <hi>which after had the Name of</hi> Certicks-ford: <hi>He gather'd an Army out of all</hi> Britain; <hi>and</hi> Certic <hi>with his Son to enable themſelves to encounter him, had in ſo great danger obtain'd Aid from</hi> Aeſca <hi>King of</hi> Kent, <hi>and</hi> Ella <hi>the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent King of the</hi> South-Saxons, <hi>as likewiſe from</hi> Port <hi>and his Son lately ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd; which Forces were divided into two main Bodies, one led by</hi> Certic, <hi>the other by his Son</hi> Cenric. <hi>When the Battle was joyn'd, King</hi> Nazaleod, <hi>perceiving the right Wing of the Enemies, conducted by</hi> Certic, <hi>was much ſtronger than the other, he turn'd all his Forces againſt it, willing to deſtroy that which was Strongeſt. He ſet upon it therefore with ſuch Violence, that he brake quite through them, threw down their Enſign, forc'd</hi> Certic <hi>to fly, and made a great Slaughter of his Army in a ſhort time: But</hi> Cenric, <hi>who conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the left Wing, ſeeing his Fathers Army routed, ruſh'd vehemently on the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:96414:68"/>backs of the</hi> Britains, <hi>whilſt they purſu'd their Enemies flying; by this means the Combat became furious, inſomuch as King</hi> Nazaleod <hi>was ſlain, and the</hi> Britains <hi>forc'd to fly, of whom there fell</hi> 5000. <hi>and the reſt ſav'd themſelves by their ſwiftneſs.</hi> Thus the <hi>Saxons</hi> obtain'd a great Victory, ſo that for ſome years they were not diſturb'd by the <hi>Britains;</hi> and the rather, for that great multitudes of Valiant Soldiers, came out of <hi>Germany</hi> to joyn with them. This famous Battle fought in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> the Province of the <hi>Belgae,</hi> between the entire Forces of all the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Britains,</hi> as it were for the Maſtery, had utterly ruin'd the <hi>Britiſh</hi> State, had <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ter</hi> left behind him a Succeſſor of a Courage leſs Heroical, then his Son <hi>Arthur</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd Prince, whoſe glorious Exploits are now to be related.</p>
            <p>The Geſts of this Son and Succeſſor of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ter,</hi> are clouded by ſuch miſts of Fables, that the Truth of his Story can hardly be related, not for want, but the exceſs of matter recorded of him, and that by Writers, who out of a deſire to magnifie his Fame, by their impudent Lies have almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd his memory, and render'd him to Poſterity a meer Romantick Phantaſm. That there was ſuch a Prince as <hi>Arthur,</hi> and that he was Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious by many Victories over the <hi>Saxons</hi> in defence of his Country, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably be queſtion'd; But as to his Exploits abroad, his Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Table and feigned Knights, we may well leave them to be juſtify'd by the Dreaming <hi>Bards</hi> of that Age: True it is, that <hi>Malbranc</hi> a Learned <hi>French</hi> Antiquary, miſled by a wrong tranſcrib'd paſſage out of <hi>Gildas,</hi> will needs confound <hi>Arthur</hi> with <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius,</hi> as if <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ter</hi> had been the Father and not the Brother of <hi>Aurelius:</hi> Whereas our Antient and moſt Prudent Hiſtorians agree, that without doubt <hi>Arthur</hi> was the Son of <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ter</hi> obtain'd, being transform'd by the skill of <hi>Merlin</hi> into the ſhape of her Husband: But the Virtues, Piety and Courage of this renown'd Prince, recompenc'd by God himſelf with wonderful ſucceſs, ſeem not to ſuit with a Birth ſo infamous. A more ſober account is given of him, in the Antiquities of <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> where we may find, <hi>That</hi> Uterpendragon <hi>the Brother of</hi> Aurelius Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius <hi>dying by Poiſon, after the coming of</hi> Cerdic <hi>the</hi> Weſt Saxon, <hi>his Son</hi> Arthur <hi>a Youth of</hi> 15 <hi>years, began to reign over the</hi> Britains, <hi>his Mothers Name was</hi> Igerna; <hi>born he was in a Caſtle of</hi> Cornwall, <hi>call'd</hi> Tintagel. In this Narration, no aſperſion is caſt upon his Birth, but rather an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliſhment of it; for it ſeems to affirm him deſcended from a Nephew of St. <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathaea</hi> call'd <hi>Hellanis:</hi> Whether he were no more then 15 years of Age when his Father dy'd may be a queſtion, in regard men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of his Noble Exploits in the time of <hi>Ambroſius: Arthur</hi> was not preſent in the Army when his Father <hi>

               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:96414:68"/>Sir-nam'd <hi>Albanius,</hi> who bare a particular Affection to Prince <hi>Arthur:</hi> This <hi>Huel</hi> being of a reſtleſs Spirit, made frequent inroads into <hi>Britain,</hi> as may be found in the Life of St. <hi>Gildas;</hi> and ſo Cruelly waſted the Country, that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> King ſent Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> with a numerous Army, who began a furious War with the young <hi>Pict,</hi> and after divers Defeats and Purſuits, ſlew him in the Iſland <hi>Minau.</hi> This War of <hi>Arthur</hi>'s with the <hi>Picts,</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſion to mention this St. <hi>Gildas,</hi> it will not be unſeaſonable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his Geſts, and the rather, that in courſe of Story, he be diſtinguiſh'd from another <hi>Gildas</hi> his Contemporary, ſtil'd <hi>Sapiens</hi> or <hi>Hiſtoricus,</hi> and the younger of the two, of whom more hereafter.</p>
            <p>Theſe two are not ſeldom confounded together by Antient Writers, by reaſon they agreed in Name and many good Qualities: Howbeit this Elder <hi>Gildas,</hi> as we read in his Life, <hi>Was the Son of</hi> Con <hi>King of</hi> Albania; <hi>and being in his Childhood of an excellent Diſpoſition, was carefully inſtructed, and did wonderfully profit in good Literature. After he was ſent into</hi> Gaul, <hi>for the increaſe of his knowledge; where, having abode ſeven years, he return'd into</hi> Britain, <hi>furniſh'd not with Learning only, but abundance of Books alſo. The report of his Eminent Learning drew many to him from all quarters, to ſuck inſtruction from him. But he took more care to enrich himſelf with Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Piety then Knowledge; and indeed none was to be found in all thoſe Regions comparable to him in Aſſiduous Prayers, Faſting, Sack-cloath and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications: He wholly abſtain'd from Fleſh, contenting himſelf with Barly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread and Herbs, with which he mix'd Aſhes, to abate the Pleaſure he might take in the taſte of his Food. His Drink was pure Water from the Fountain: He would ordinarily at midnight plunge himſelf in the River for Mortification, and ſpend the reſt of the night in Prayer, by which Auſterities he became ſo lean, as if he had been in a Conſumption. Whatever was beſtow'd on him by rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he preſently diſtributed amongſt the poor: His Charity drew him into</hi> Ireland, <hi>where the Goſpel of Chriſt was not ſo well ſettled, and there he ſpent many years in inſtructing that Nation; but being inform'd, that in the more</hi> Northern <hi>parts of his own Country,</hi> Gentiliſm <hi>was generally profeſs'd, and that thoſe few Chriſtians who liv'd there, were Poiſon'd with many Hereſies, he return'd thither; and being thorough furniſh'd with the Armour of God, he demonſtrated to the</hi> Pagans, <hi>that the ſuppos'd Deities Worſhip'd by them, were nothing but the Inventions of Impious men: And to the</hi> Hereticks, <hi>that what they held, was contrary to Divine Truth reveal'd to Gods Church, by which means he is ſaid to have brought the</hi> Pagans <hi>to deſtroy their Idols and Prophane Temples, to receive Baptiſme, and erect Churches: The</hi> Hereticks <hi>alſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into the boſome of the</hi> Catholick Church: <hi>Now to make his Preaching more effectual; our Lord was pleas'd to give him a Plentiful Grace in Healing the Sick, giving Sight to the Blind, Curing the Deaf, Cleanſing the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So that his Preaching confirm'd by frequent Miracles, ſpread the true Faith through all thoſe Provinces, to the glory of God and the inexpreſſible joy of St.</hi> Gildas. After this imployment, ſome ſay he took a Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> others more probably; that being invited by the Holy Abbot St. <hi>Cadocus,</hi> he preſided over the Studies of many young Scholars in the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy of <hi>Lancarvan,</hi> where he continu'd only one year, leaving there a Book of the four Evangeliſts tranſcrib'd by himſelf: St. <hi>Gildas</hi> having ended the year of his Preſidentſhip, and his Scholars retiring from their Studies, withdrew himſelf into a certain Iſland, as St. <hi>Cadocus</hi> did into another, the Iſlands were <hi>Ronech</hi> and <hi>Echni;</hi> while St. <hi>Gildas</hi> continu'd there in Prayer

            <p>At this time <hi>Melvas</hi> a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Prince reign'd in the Province of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> call'd by the <hi>Britains Gladarhaf:</hi> This <hi>Melvas</hi> had ſtollen away <hi>Guinivera,</hi> wife to King <hi>Arthur,</hi> concealing her in the Iſle of <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> eſteem'd moſt ſecure, both for the Fenny Scituation, and Religion of the place: Hereupon King <hi>Arthur</hi> aſſembled a mighty Army out of <hi>Cornwall</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire,</hi> and encompaſs'd the Iſland: The two Kings being ready to joyn Battle, the Abbot of <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> attended by St. <hi>Gildas</hi> and all the Clergy, came between the two Armies, and by perſwaſion induc'd <hi>Melvas</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Queen to her Husband, which being perform'd, Peace enſu'd, and both the Kings beſtow'd great Poſſeſſions and Immunities on the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: After which St. <hi>Gildas,</hi> with the Abbots permiſſion, retir'd again to an Hermetical Solitude on the bank of the River <hi>Axus</hi> near <hi>Glaſtonbury;</hi> where he built a Church, Conſecrating it to the Bleſſed Trinity, and there ſpent his time in Prayer, Faſting and other Auſterities; His Sanctity was ſo exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary, that many came from the fartheſt part of <hi>Britain</hi> to viſit him, and take Spiritual Councel from him: He then fell into a Sickneſs, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Death approach'd, he call'd to him the Abbot of <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> and requeſted of him, <hi>That his Body might be buried in the Church of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery;</hi> which was readily granted: So the Holy man dying the 4th. day before the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> many ſaw an Angelical Splendour about his Sacred Body, which yielded a moſt Pleaſant Odour. And after a ſolemn Recommendation of his Soul with many Tears of the Religious, his Sacred Body was carry'd with great Honour to the Church, and there bury'd in the midſt of the Pavement of the Antient Church, in the year of Grace 512. What hath been here related, agrees with the Antient Monuments of <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> where this Holy man is ſtil'd <hi>Hiſtoricus, neque Inſulſus, neque Infacetus,</hi> and moſt particulars of his Life are with a large Character of him, confirm'd in the <hi>Gallican Martyrology,</hi> where is alſo added, <hi>That he being during his Childhood ſent into</hi> France, <hi>was recommended to the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of</hi> Iltutus, <hi>a Diſciple of St.</hi> German; <hi>and that his Voyage into</hi> Ireland, <hi>was to root out many Hereſies ſprung up amongſt the late Converted Chriſtians, and to reform many Vices and unlawful Cuſtoms; and that the Hereſie moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by him in the</hi> Northern <hi>parts of</hi> Britain, <hi>was</hi> Pelagianiſm: What is there ſaid of his going over to <hi>Little Britain</hi> in his old Age, and his being buried in the Church of <hi>Vannes,</hi> contradicts our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Authors; but it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that when the <hi>Saxons</hi> infeſted our <hi>Weſtern</hi> Provinces, his Sacred Relicks might be tranſlated, and repos'd in the great Church of <hi>Vannes,</hi> where he is to this day Venerated as Patron of that City. Many miſtakes have fallen out by conſounding this St. <hi>Gildas,</hi> with two others, one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor and Abbot of <hi>Bangor,</hi> and another the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> Sirnam'd <hi>Badonicus:</hi> Howbeit the preciſe Territory where this <hi>Gildas Albanius</hi> was born, may be collected out of Antient Manuſcripts quoted by Biſhop <hi>

            <p>In the ſixth year after the Battle where <hi>

The <hi>Sun</hi> then ariſing, caſt its beams upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Armour, and reflecting thence, partly from the Mountains, and partly from the Valleys below, ſtruck a great Terrour into the <hi>Saxons;</hi> But when they came to Fight, the <hi>Britains</hi> were quickly defeated, becauſe God deſpis'd them: By this Victory the <hi>Saxons</hi> gain'd a great extent of Land, and <hi>Cerdic</hi> became ſo Terrible, that he march'd whither he pleas'd without controll.</p>
            <p>The year following, <hi>Ella</hi> King of the <hi>South-Saxons</hi> dying, his Son <hi>Ciſſa</hi> ſucceeded; whilſt <hi>Ella</hi> liv'd, though his Territories were narrow, yet was he for his Courage eſteem'd the moſt potent of all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Princes; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as the Princes, Nobles and Military Officers of the <hi>Angli</hi> had a great dependance on him: But this laſted not long, for it was ſhortly after transferr'd on <hi>Cerdic</hi> the <hi>Weſt-Saxon,</hi> whoſe Kingdom, though not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, yet had its foundation from this Victory: <hi>Ciſſa</hi> being of a milder Spirit, contented himſelf with his own little Kingdom, without extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Power further. He imploy'd his time in exerciſes of Peace, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Building and Fortifying of Cities: In two of which he left the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his own Name <hi>Chicheſter</hi> and <hi>Cisbury,</hi> as our <hi>Cambden</hi> relates, adding, <hi>That this</hi> Ciſſa, <hi>with his Father</hi> Ella <hi>and Brother</hi> Cimen, <hi>landed in a Port of that Province, call'd therefore</hi> Cimenſhore.</p>
            <p>The year wherein <hi>Cerdic</hi> obtain'd the laſt mention'd Victory, is famous for the Birth of the renown'd <hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhop St. <hi>Kontigern;</hi> the ſtrangeneſs of which, ſince it is Celebrated by many Antient Writers, is not here to be omitted. His Mother is ſaid to be <hi>Thenis</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Loth</hi> King of <hi>Pictland,</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> the Daughter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terpendragon,</hi> and conſequently he was the Nephew of King <hi>Arthur.</hi> Who was the Father of St. <hi>Kentigern</hi> is not certainly known, ſome ſuppoſe him to be <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Third King of the <hi>Scots. John</hi> of <hi>Tinmouth</hi> an Antient Hiſtorian thus relates his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, <hi>A certain King in the</hi> Northern <hi>parts of</hi> Britain, <hi>who was a</hi> Pagan, <hi>begot of his Wife a very Beautiful Daughter; ſhe having been a frequent hearer of Sermons preach'd by the Servants of God, obtain'd the Grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Truth, and renounce the Worſhiping of Idols; and though ſhe had not yet been Purified with the Sacrament of Baptiſm; yet ſhe was diligent in obſerving Gods Commandments with an Humble and Devout mind, being much given to Prayer and Alms-giving, and other Duties of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, as much as the fear of offending her Father would permit. She bore ſo great a Devotion to the fruitful Virginity and Integrity of the Bleſſed Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>that mov'd with a Womaniſh preſumption, ſhe beg'd of our Lord that ſhe might in ſome meaſure imitate her in her Conception and Birth: At length, as ſhe thought, ſhe obtain'd her deſire, for ſhe found her ſelf with Child.</hi> Now it is not to be conceiv'd that this happ'ned without the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of a man; notwithſtanding who this man was, or in what manner, and when this was done, ſhe oft Proteſted, and with Oaths confirm'd it, that ſhe was utterly ignorant. <hi>Her Father perceiving this, and not being able either by fair Speeches or Threatnings to wreſt from her, who was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Child; for ſhe ſeriouſly Proteſted, that ſhe had never ſuffer'd the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Embraces of any man: Hereupon in a great rage determin'd to execute upon her the Law of the Country; which was,</hi> That whatſoever young Maid
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96414:70"/>ſhould be found with Child by Fornication in her Fathers Houſe, ſhould be thrown Head-long from the top of a high Mountain, and the perſon who corrupted her ſhould looſe his Head: <hi>In conformity to this Law, the young Woman was placed on the higheſt part of a mountain in that Country call'd</hi> Dunpelder, <hi>from thence to be thrown down and torn in pieces: She therefore with deep Sighs, looking up to Heaven, implor'd the Mercy and Help of her Redeemer with many Tears; after this ſhe was caſt down, but by the fall was neither bruis'd, nor receiv'd the leaſt harm, but ſliding down eaſily and ſlowly, came ſafe to the bottom: The</hi> Pagans <hi>there preſent, aſcrib'd this deliverance to the Magical Inchantments of the Chriſtians, and therefore with the Kings Conſent, they carried her ſeveral Miles into the Sea, and there left her in a ſmall Boat made of Leather without any Oares, and deſtitute of all Humane help: But it ſeems he who commands the Winds and the Seas was her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector; for by his Power the Boat was carried ſtraight to a far diſtant Haven, with greater ſwiftneſs then either Oares or Sails could have driven her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there arriv'd, the young Lady ſoon after at a place call'd</hi> Collenros, <hi>was deliver'd without the aſſiſtance of a Midwife, of a Son:</hi> This <hi>Collenros</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably is the ſame which St. <hi>Bede</hi> calls <hi>Coludi,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy Colania</hi> in the Province of <hi>Louden: The next morning St.</hi> Servanus <hi>came to the place, and ſeeing the deſolate Mother with her Infant, ſaid,</hi> My Beloved Child, Bleſſed art thou who art come in the Name of the Lord: <hi>He took them into his care, nouriſh'd and Baptiz'd them, calling the Mother</hi> Thanen, <hi>and the Child</hi> Kentigern, that is, <hi>Cheif-Lord.</hi> The Child being of a towardly Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, profited, much in Learning and Virtue, and was Belov'd of St. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanus</hi> beyond all his Companions, and call'd <hi>Munhu,</hi> as he is ſtill nam'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Scots:</hi> So as they who affirm his Birth to have been at St. <hi>Aſaph</hi> in <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> are much miſtaken; which miſtake perhaps ariſeth from his being afterwards Biſhop there. However, after 25 years, we ſhall find him Conſecrated Biſhop of <hi>Glaſco,</hi> and then more is to be ſaid of him.</p>
            <p>The continual Troubles rais'd by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> would not permit King <hi>Arthur</hi> to Solemnize his Coronation, 'till eight years after his Fathers death: But in the year of Grace 516. the Ceremony was Magnificently perform'd in a General Aſſembly of Biſhops and Nobles at <hi>Caerleon;</hi> St. <hi>Dubritius</hi> Biſhop of that City ſetting the Crown on his Head. After which the Holy Biſhop retir'd into a certain Iſland in <hi>Northwales</hi> call'd by the <hi>Britains Enhly,</hi> and by the <hi>Engliſh Berdſey,</hi> which Iſland (ſaith <hi>Cambden</hi>) <hi>Was inhabited by ſo many Saints, that beſide</hi> Dubritius <hi>and</hi> Merlin <hi>the</hi> Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian <hi>no fewer then</hi> 20000 <hi>Holy men were Buried there, as Records inform us.</hi> Concerning this Iſland (ſaith Biſhop <hi>

            <p>At this time the <hi>Saxons</hi> invited more of their Country-men out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi> And under the conduct of <hi>Colgrin,</hi> they ſubdu'd all that part of <hi>Britain,</hi> which lyes from <hi>Humber</hi> to the Sea of <hi>Cathanes;</hi> whereof, when King <hi>Arthur</hi> was inform'd, he march'd with an Army towards <hi>York,</hi> which was then held by the <hi>Saxons.

               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:96414:70"/>was put to flight, and purſu'd by King <hi>Arthur</hi> to <hi>York.

Theſe great ſuccours frighted the <hi>Britains</hi> from their Siege, ſo as the King retir'd with his Army to <hi>London,</hi> from whence he ſent Meſſengers to his Nephew <hi>Hoel</hi> King of <hi>Little-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> to inform him of the Calamity of this Iſland. <hi>Hoel</hi> to ſuccour his Uncle, landed ſhortly after with 15000 men at the Haven of <hi>Hamon,</hi> where he was with great Joy and Honour receiv'd by King <hi>Arthur:</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd with theſe new Forces, he obtain'd the next year two famous Victories againſt the <hi>Saxons;</hi> the former near the River <hi>Baſsas,</hi> the latter in the Wood <hi>Chelidon,</hi> both in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> near <hi>Lincoln</hi> the chief City. No fewer then 6000 of the <hi>Saxons</hi> were ſlain, the reſt fled into the Wood or Forreſt of <hi>Caledon,</hi> and were purſu'd by King <hi>Arthur,</hi> and there Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur'd by great Trees cut down, and laid athwart, ſo as they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reduc'd to ſuch extream Famine, that they beg'd leave to depart the Realm, leaving all their Spoils behind them: By this Exploit the <hi>Saxons</hi> were driven out of the middle part of <hi>Britain:</hi> Howbeit in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> part they ſo prevail'd, that <hi>Cerdicus</hi> there eſtabliſh'd a Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Another Victory this Heroick King is ſaid to have obtain'd, though the time be not mention'd, againſt theſe Barbarous Enemies near the Caſtle call'd <hi>Guinnion.</hi> In which Battle the King carried upon his Shoulders the Image of the Bleſſed Virgin-mother of God, and all that day by the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and St. <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd the <hi>Saxons</hi> to fly, after many had periſh'd with a great ſlaughter; the ſucceeding Exploits of this King follow after.</p>

Thereupon entring his Boat, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting himſelf to the Sea and Winds, he landed in an Iſland, then call'd <hi>Lemeney,</hi> in which <hi>Honorius</hi> a Devout Son of King <hi>Thefrianc</hi> then liv'd a Mortify'd Holy Life, having preferr'd Poverty, and a free Attendance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, before all Worldly Conveniences: By him St. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd with all Benignity, and offer'd the ſame Manſion, wherein he might without diſtraction, gain Souls to our Lord: But this offer St. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> would not accept, but upon condition that the Siſter of St. <hi>Honorius</hi> and a Maid attending on her, might no longer abide in the ſame Iſland: This ſcrupulouſneſs was derided by ſome Miſ-believers, but comply'd with by St. <hi>Honorius,</hi> who ſent his Siſter to another place, that he might enjoy the Inſtruction and Converſation of the Holy man: After this many repair'd to him to be Inſtructed in the Chriſtian Faith and Piety, who return'd ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently Enlightn'd; both to find the way of Salvation themſelves, and to teach it to others. Now when the fame of ſo great a Saint came to the knowledge of St. <hi>David;</hi> He ſent for him, and receiv'd him with great Honour, making choice of him for his Confeſſor, and under God the chief Director of his Soul, and granted to him and his Brethren convenient Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both in the Iſland and adjoyning Continent, ſuch as they themſelves had choſen: It is ſaid the malice and envy of the Devil interrupted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd the Devout and Mortify'd Life of this Holy man by frequent Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſuggeſting ſcandalous Lies concerning him; But in the end the Enemy of Manking finding himſelf vanquiſh'd by the Saint, and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by violent Aſſaults, nor by malicious Suggeſtions, he could withdraw him from the Service of God; he attempted other guileful Arts and Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, by infuſing the Poiſon of his Malice into the Hearts of three of the Holy mans Servants; for they being reprov'd by him for their Idleneſs, were ſoon inflam'd with fury againſt him; inſomuch, as ruſhing all upon him, they threw him to the ground, and cruelly cut off his Head: Where the Sacred Head fell, a Fountain of pure Water preſently flow'd, by Drinking of which in following times, many have been Miraculouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to Health: But in truth greater Miracles ſucceeded his Death, for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96414:71"/>it is conſtantly affirm'd, <hi>That the Body of the Bleſſed Martyr preſently aroſe, and taking the Head between the two Arms, went down to the Sea-ſhore, and walking thence on the Sea, paſs'd over to the Port call'd by his Name; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arriv'd at a place where a Church is now built to his memory, it fell down, and was there bury'd by St.</hi> David <hi>with Spiritual Hymns and Canticles: In which Church our Lord hath frequently vouchſafed to atteſt the Sanctity of his Servant by many Miracles.</hi> The name of this Iſland now is <hi>Ramſey,</hi> it lies in ſight of <hi>Menevia,</hi> the Epiſcopal ſeat of St. <hi>David,</hi> and oppoſite to it. And it is affirm'd by <hi>Cambden, To be famous for the death of of a Holy man call'd</hi> Juſtinian, <hi>who coming from</hi> Little Britain, <hi>liv'd a Solitary Life, but was at laſt Murdered by his Servants, and inſcrib'd in the Catalogue of Martyrs.</hi>

Theſe fixed themſelves in a place call'd <hi>Mauritania,</hi> where St. <hi>Patern</hi> built a Church and Monaſtery, in which he plac'd the Monks under a Provoſt and Dean: The Name <hi>Mauritania</hi> ſeems to be a miſtake, for the Church within the Province of the <hi>Dimetae</hi> or <hi>Weſt-Wales,</hi> was Dedicated to the Honour of St. <hi>Paternus;</hi> after the Pronunciation of the <hi>Britains,</hi> is call'd <hi>Llan Patern Maur,</hi> from which laſt word, <hi>Mauritania</hi> may creep in: The Monaſtery here built by St. <hi>Paternus,</hi> ſent abroad many Colonies of Religious Perſons into the Province <hi>Ceretica,</hi> now <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diganſhire:</hi> As for the Church he call'd <hi>Mauritania</hi> or <hi>Llan Patern Maur,</hi> it was an Epiſcopal See, wherein St. <hi>Paternus</hi> himſelf firſt ſate, whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, both as an Abbot and a Biſhop, hath been long ſince Celebrated by a famous Poet <hi>Venantius Fortunatus:</hi> After 21 years ſpent by St. <hi>Paternus</hi> in governing this See, from him call'd <hi>Paternenſis;</hi> He was by Prince <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoc,</hi> re-call'd into his Native Country <hi>Little Britain,</hi> and made Biſhop of <hi>Vannes,</hi> having left in his former Biſhoprick <hi>Kinock</hi> his Succeſſor: There was alſo another St. <hi>Paternus</hi> a Biſhop in <hi>France,</hi> many of whoſe Geſts have been aſcrib'd to the former, ſo as ſome doubt is made which of thoſe ſubſcrib'd the Synod of <hi>Paris,</hi> aſſembled in the year of Grace 569.</p>
            <p>About this time dy'd St. <hi>Darerca</hi> Siſter of St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> and born in <hi>Britain,</hi> from whence ſhe repair'd to her Brother in <hi>Ireland;</hi> ſhe was alſo called <hi>Monynni,</hi> and by ſome confounded with St. <hi>Moduenna,</hi> of whom more hereafter. St. <hi>Darerca</hi> was a Married Woman, and by two Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands enrich'd the Church with a numerous and Holy off-ſpring; by her Husband <hi>Conis,</hi> ſhe is ſaid to have brought forth three Children, <hi>Mel, Rioch</hi> and <hi>Menni,</hi> all which accompanied St. <hi>Patrick</hi> in his Journeys and Preaching, and were in ſeveral places exalted to the Epiſcopal Function: Of St. <hi>Rioch</hi> we read, <hi>That he was by Nation a</hi> Britain, <hi>near Kinſman to the Holy Biſhop St.</hi> Patrick; <hi>and a Deacon when he attended him into</hi> Ireland, <hi>and that in Beauty and Comlineſs of Body, he excell'd all others of that Nation.</hi> But the Beauty of his Soul was much more valuable: He ſeems to have been Ordain'd Biſhop by St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> and to have fix'd his ſeat in a ſmall Iſland, which according to St. <hi>Bede</hi> is ſcituated at ſome diſtance from the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Coaſts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and is call'd the Iſle of <hi>Whitecalfe;</hi> where St. <hi>Coleman</hi> afterwards built a Monaſtery, and is promiſcuouſly Inhabited by <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots:</hi> St. <hi>Dererca</hi> had many other Sons famous for their Sanctity, but we ſhall now take notice only of two more Illuſtrious then
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96414:72"/>the reſt; the firſt <hi>Sechnallus,</hi> in <hi>Latin, Secundinus,</hi> who wrote the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betical <hi>Hymn</hi> in Praiſe of St. <hi>Patrick.</hi> The others name was <hi>Auxilius,</hi> who was by St. <hi>Patrick</hi> ordain'd Biſhop of <hi>Leimſter (Laginenſium)</hi> and after many Miracles wrought by him, ended his Holy Life in <hi>Cealuſalli,</hi> his own City, ſeated in the Plaines of <hi>Leimſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year of Grace 519. a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Synod was aſſembled; upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. The deteſtable <hi>Hereſie</hi> of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> extinguiſh'd by St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus</hi> and St. <hi>Lupus,</hi> began to Spring again, to the hazard of the <hi>Catholick Faith.</hi> The Biſhops and Abbots of <hi>Cambria</hi> met in <hi>Cardiganſhire,</hi> divers Noble-men and other Lay-perſons were preſent out of the whole Country; many Sermons and Exhortations were made in the publick Audience to confute the ſaid <hi>Hereſie:</hi> Howbeit, the People were generally ſo infected therewith, that no reaſons or perſwaſions could prevail with them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the Path of Right Faith: At length therefore <hi>Paulin,</hi> a Biſhop with whom St. <hi>David</hi> in his youth had been Educated, earneſtly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Fathers to ſend for St. <hi>David</hi> in the Name of the Synod, who was lately Conſecrated Biſhop by the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> and was a Diſcreet and Eloquent man, to afford his aſſiſtance to Gods Church now in great danger, but could not prevail with him to forſake his Contemplations, until at laſt two Holy men, <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Dubritius</hi> by their Authority brought him with them to the Synod. And then all the Fathers there Aſſembled, enjoyn'd St. <hi>David</hi> to Preach. He commanded a Child, which had lately been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to Life by him, to ſpread a Napkin under his feet, and ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, he began to expound the Goſpel and the Law to the Auditory: All the while he continued his Oration, a Snow-white Dove deſcending from Heaven, ſate upon his Shoulders, and the Earth on which he ſtood, rais'd it ſelf under him, 'till it became a Hill, from whence his Voice like a Trumpet was clearly heard and underſtood by all both far and near: On the top of which Hill a Church was afterwards built, which remains to this day: When the Sermon was finiſh'd, ſo Powerfully did Divine Grace Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate; that the <hi>Hereſie</hi> ſoon vaniſh'd and was extinguiſh'd: And the Holy Biſhop St. <hi>David,</hi> by the general Election and Acclamation both of Clergy and People, was exalted to be the Arch-biſhop of all <hi>Cambria.</hi> By the Confuſions of thoſe times, the Decrees of this and other Synods are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily loſt; by which we might have been inform'd of the State of the then <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church; yet ſomething of it may be collected out of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of St. <hi>David</hi>'s Life, who tells us, <hi>That</hi> Hereſie <hi>being thus expell'd, all the Churches of</hi> Britain, <hi>receiv'd their Order and Rule, from the Authority of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church;</hi> By which we may ſee the miſtake of ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Writers, who will needs affirm that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church before the Converſion of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> in their Faith and Diſcipline, were ſquar'd after the Model of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church. This Synod <hi>Spelman</hi> calls <hi>Panbritani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum;</hi> and ſoon after it, Monaſteries were built in ſeveral places, and this Holy Biſhop St. <hi>David</hi> became the chief Protector of them, and withall a Preacher of ſuch eſteem, that all men receiv'd a Rule and Form of Holy living from him. This expedient the Holy Spirit ſuggeſted to the Antient Fathers, namely the Building of Monaſteries, thereby to promote and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the <hi>Catholick Faith;</hi> for out of them ſtill proceeded ſome to inſtruct Believers in Faith and Holineſs of Life. But another Spirit ſuggeſted <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian,</hi> the Infidel <hi>Saxons,</hi> and ſome Zealots of late days, to deſtroy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, as a ſure means to deſtroy Faith and Holineſs alſo. It may not
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96414:72"/>here be unprofitable to deſcribe the form of a Monaſtick Life inſtituted by St. <hi>David;</hi> who having built a Monaſtery near <hi>Menevia,</hi> in a place call'd <hi>Roſma,</hi> or the <hi>Roſey Valley,</hi> gave this ſtrict Rule of Monaſtical Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>That every Monk ſhould labour daily with his Hands for the common good of the Monaſtery. For Idleneſs corrupts the Thoughts and Minds of men. The Monks there were not to take Gifts or Poſſeſſions from unjuſt perſons, and deteſted Riches; they had no care to eaſe their Labours by uſe of Oxen or Cattle, for every one to himſelf and his Brethren was inſtead of Riches and Oxen. They never convers'd together by talking, but when neceſſity requir'd, but each one perform'd the labour enjoyn'd him, joyning thereto Prayer or Holy Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on Divine things. And having finiſh'd their Country work, they return'd to the Monaſtery, where they ſpent the remainder of the day till Even, in Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Writing: At Even upon the ſounding of a Bell, they all left their work and repair'd to Church, where they remain'd 'till the Stars appear'd, and then went all together to their Refection, eating ſparingly, and not to ſatiety; their Food was Bread, with Roots or Herbs ſeaſon'd with Salt, and they quench'd their Thirſt mith a mixture of Water and Milk: Supper being ended, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued three hours in Watching, Prayers and Genu-flexions. As long as they were in the Church, it was not permitted to any to Slumber, Sneeze or Spit. After this they went to their Reſt, and at Cock-crowing, they roſe and continu'd at Prayers 'till day appear'd. All their inward temptations and thoughts they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to their Superior, and from him they demanded permiſſion in all things, even when they were urg'd to the neceſſities of Nature. Their Cloathing was of the Skins of Beaſts: Whoſoever deſir'd to joyn himſelf in their Holy Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, he was oblig'd to remain</hi> 10 <hi>days at the door of the Monaſtery as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, unworthy to be admitted into their Society, and there be expos'd to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probious ſcorns: But if all that time he Patiently ſuffer'd all Mortifications, he was receiv'd by the Religious</hi> Senior, <hi>who had care of the Gate, whom he ſerv'd, and by whom he was inſtructed; in which condition he remain'd a long time, exercis'd in painful Labours, and grievous Mortifications; and ſo at laſt was admitted to the Fellowſhip of the Brethren. Cambden</hi> makes mention of this Synod, ſaying, <hi>Llandevibrevi, or the Church of St.</hi> David <hi>near the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> Brevi, <hi>was built in memory of St.</hi> David <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Menevia, <hi>in the place where He, during the ſitting of a full Synod, confuted and repreſs'd the</hi> Pelagian Hereſie <hi>reviving in</hi> Britain, <hi>by the Holy Scriptures and, Miracles; For, as the Fame is, the Earth on which he Preach'd, ſwell'd up under his feet till it became a Hill.</hi> This Synod it ſeems was celebrated, not in Houſe or Town, but in the open Fields, as afterwards St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk held a Councel in a place, from thence call'd <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s <hi>Oak;</hi> and as Antiently <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> Aſſembled a Synod in the Cauſe of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> in a place call'd, <hi>Ad Quercum, at the Oak.</hi> Now whereas in this Synod were Aſſembled many great Saints and Holy Biſhops, the Lights of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches, as St. <hi>Dubritius,</hi> St. <hi>Daniel,</hi> St. <hi>David,</hi> St. <hi>Telian,</hi> and St. <hi>Paulin,</hi> of whom ſome mention hath been made already, it will not be amiſs, here to ſubjoyn a ſummary of their reſpective Geſts; leaſt if they ſhould be ſet down par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, there would be ſuch intermixture as might perhaps confound the Readers memory, eſpecially conſidering the wonderful length of time which moſt of them liv'd. Concerning St. <hi>Daniel,</hi> enough hath been ſaid. We ſhall here begin with St. <hi>Dubritius,</hi> who was born in the Province of the <hi>Demetae,</hi> or <hi>Weſt-wales,</hi> Sir-nam'd he was <hi>Guainius,</hi> from the River <hi>Guain,</hi> near which he was born; his Fathers Name is not mention'd, but
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96414:73"/>his Mother was call'd <hi>Euedyla,</hi> a Woman of wonderful Virtue and Piety; during his Childhood, he was committed to the care of Teachers, to be inſtructed in Learning ſuitable to that Age: In his riper years he made ſuch Progreſs in Science, that very many, not only among the Ignorant, but the more skilful alſo, repair'd to him for Inſtructions. Amongſt which were St. <hi>Thelian,</hi> St <hi>Sampſon,</hi> St. <hi>Aidan,</hi> and others: He made choice of a place near the River <hi>Vaga,</hi> proper to receive the great number of Scholars, which came to him; and there directed their Studies. In the ſame place having built a Church by the direction of an Angel, he there taught the People, and by impoſing his Hands, Cur'd frequently the Sick of divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; ſo that they which came to him Feeble, and full of Anguiſh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd Joyful, and in Perfect Health: He was taken from his Imployment of Teaching by St. <hi>German</hi> in his ſecond Voyage to <hi>Britain,</hi> and with the conſent of King <hi>Mauricus</hi> and all the Clergy, Conſecrated Biſhop of <hi>Llan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daff,</hi> as hath been ſaid in the year of Grace 436. by which account, ſince he out-liv'd the ſaid Synod of <hi>Brevi;</hi> it is plain, the length of his Life was wonderful, for at that time he had been a Biſhop more then 80 years.</p>
            <p>In the year 492. <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius</hi> coming to the Mountains of <hi>Ambri,</hi> near to <hi>Caer Carec,</hi> now <hi>Salisbury,</hi> where the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Princes Trayterouſly Murder'd by <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> lay, appointed Paſtors to two Metropolitan Churches, granting <hi>York</hi> to the Illuſtrious St. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and <hi>Caerleon</hi> to <hi>Dubritius,</hi> the latter vacant by the Death of <hi>Threminius; Geoffry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> adds, <hi>That he was Primate of</hi> Britain, <hi>and Legate of the Apoſtolick See;</hi> Which Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſeems was annexed to that Church by St. <hi>German,</hi> from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which in his Miſſion hither he receiv'd from <hi>Rome.</hi> In the year 516 He Solemnly Crown'd King <hi>Arthur;</hi> after which being very Aged, as hath been ſaid, he relinquiſh'd his See, and retir'd into the Iſle of <hi>Berdſey</hi> to prepare for his Death; from which repoſe notwithſtanding, his Zeal to the Catholick Faith, drew him to the Synod of <hi>Brevy,</hi> St. <hi>David</hi> being his Succeſſor as aforeſaid: Three years after, full of Sanctity and Age, he gave up his Soul into the Hands of his Creatour, in the ſaid Iſle of <hi>Berd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> where, among a multitude of Saints, he choſe his place of Burial, and there his Sacred Body repos'd, until the year of Grace 1120. at which time it was tranſlated from thence with great Honour by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> and bury'd in the Cathedral Church on the <hi>North-ſide</hi> of the Altar of our Bleſſed Lady: At which time the whole Country of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> was afflicted with a great Drougth, no Rain having there fallen for many Weeks; but when theſe Holy Relicks were tranſlated, great ſtore of Rain ſell, to the comfort of the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>One of the moſt Illuſtrious Diſciples of St. <hi>Dubritius</hi> was St. <hi>Thelian,</hi> deſcended of a Noble <hi>Britiſh</hi> Family, what-ever the Centuriatours of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburg</hi> have malignantly wrote of him. From his Infancy he was addicted to Devotion, Prayer, and contempt of Secular Pleaſures; and being come to his riper Age, he was for his Wiſdom and Piety Sir-nam'd <hi>Helias,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe with his Doctrine he Enlightn'd the Hearts of the Faithful, as the <hi>Sun</hi> doth the World. He was inſtructed in the Holy Scriptures by St. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britius,</hi> 'till he was enabled to clear the moſt difficult places therein. Then having heard the fame of a certain wiſe man call'd <hi>Paulinus,</hi> he went to him to confer with him of the moſt abſtruſe Miſteries of Gods Word; by this means he contracted Friendſhip with St. <hi>David,</hi> a man of great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Sanctity; inſomuch as their Hearts were ſo firmly knit together
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96414:73"/>by Charity and the Grace of Gods Holy Spirit, that in all things they had but one Will: When St. <hi>Dubritius</hi> was tranſlated from <hi>Landaff</hi> to the Metropolitan Church of <hi>Caerleon,</hi> St. <hi>Thalian</hi> ſucceeded him in <hi>Landaff,</hi> wherein he ſate many years; For, it is ſaid, he dy'd not until the coming of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> by whom his Succeſſor St. <hi>Oudoceus</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated: When a certain Infection, call'd the Yellow Plague infeſted <hi>Britain,</hi> raging againſt Men and Beaſts, by Divine Admonition he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a far Country, accompany'd with many Diſciples, where he abode, 'till by the ſame Authority he was re-call'd: Neither did he ceaſe day or night by daily Prayer and Faſting to Pacifie Gods Wrath; and then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together all his Devout Companions, return'd; and all his Life after exercis'd Supreme Juriſdiction over all the Churches in the <hi>Weſtern Britain:</hi> He dy'd at laſt, being repleniſh'd with all Virtues in a good Old Age. Many Miracles are recorded to be done by him, both before and after his Death: One of them only which Biſhop <hi>Godwin</hi> thought not fit to paſs over, is this, <hi>After he was dead, the Inhabitants of three ſeveral places contended earneſtly, which of them ſhould enjoy his Body: Thoſe of</hi> Penualum, <hi>where his Anceſtors had been Buried, thoſe of</hi> Lantelio vaur <hi>where he dy'd; and thoſe of</hi> Landaff <hi>among whom he had been Biſhop. When therefore no agreement could be made amongſt them, there appear'd preſently three Bodies, ſo like to one another, that three Eggs reſemble not more perfectly: Whereupon each of thoſe People took one of them, and ſo ended the Controverſy:</hi> But by frequent Miracles at his Tomb in <hi>Landaff,</hi> it appear'd that the Inhabitants thereof poſſeſs'd the true Body.</p>
            <p>Now whereas mention is made of <hi>Paulinus,</hi> ſaid to be Inſtructer to <hi>Thelian,</hi> and who ſent for St. <hi>David</hi> to the Synod of <hi>Brevi:</hi> His true Name ſeems to be <hi>Paulens,</hi> of whom we find it thus written, <hi>That St.</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>as ſoon as he was promoted to Prieſthood, went to</hi> Paulens <hi>a Diſciple of St.</hi> German; <hi>and that in a certain Iſland he led a Holy Life acceptable to God, and that St.</hi> David <hi>liv'd with him many years, and follow'd his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</hi> Paulens <hi>at laſt by extream pains in his Eyes, loſt the uſe of them: Whereupon calling his Diſciples together, he deſir'd that one after another, they would look upon his Eyes, and ſay a Prayer or Benediction on them: But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no benefit thereby,</hi> David <hi>ſaid to him, Father command me not to look you in the face, for ten years are paſt ſince I ſtudied the Scriptures with you, and in all that time I never had the boldneſs to look you in the face;</hi> Paulens <hi>admiring his Humility, ſaid, Since it is ſo, it will ſuffice, if by touching mine Eyes thou pronounce a Benediction on them; Preſently therefore, as ſoon as he had touch'd them, Sight was reſtor'd to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame year wherein the Synod of <hi>Brevi</hi> was Celebrated, <hi>Cerdic</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the Kingdom of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons, That is</hi> (ſaith <hi>Huntingdon</hi>) <hi>in the ſeventy firſt year after the firſt coming of the</hi> Saxons, <hi>in the reign of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> Juſtin <hi>the Elder.</hi> This <hi>Cerdic</hi> is ſaid to be Crown'd with <hi>Pagan</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> in a place which once had been the Church of the true God, but which theſe Barbarous Heathens had chang'd into a Temple of <hi>Dagon,</hi> after they had ſlain all the Monks who ſerv'd God there. The raiſing of this new Kingdom, diſproves the Fictions of <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> concerning the great and frequent Victories of King <hi>Arthur</hi> in theſe days. It is likely to be more true, which <hi>Huntingdon</hi> expreſly declares, namely, <hi>That this year a terrible Battle was fought between</hi> Cerdic <hi>and the</hi> Britains, <hi>and that on both ſides the Captains Fought Magnanimouſly till Even;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96414:74"/>but then the</hi> Saxons <hi>got the Victory, which would have been more Bloody to the</hi> Britains, <hi>had not the darkneſs hind'red the Purſuit:</hi> After this the Fame of <hi>Cerdic</hi> and his Son <hi>Kenric</hi> was largely ſpread through the whole land; and from that day began the Kingdom of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons,</hi> which having ſwallow'd all the other Principalities, remains to our times. Many Battles are ſaid to have been Fought between King <hi>Arthur</hi> and this <hi>Cerdic,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſometimes one, ſometimes the other had the better; But at laſt King <hi>Arthur</hi> grew weary, and contenting himſelf with an Oath of Fidelity from <hi>Cerdic,</hi> gave him the Provinces of <hi>Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Somerſet.</hi> Some Authors affirm a League to have been made between them, wherein a ſpecial Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge was provided for <hi>Cornwall</hi> to be permitted upon an Annual Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, the free exerciſe of Chriſtian Religion: Which Indulgence ſeems to be prov'd by the great number of Saints, which in thoſe and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing times flouriſh'd in that Province; whereas ſcarce any can be found in other parts of <hi>Britain</hi> ſubject to the <hi>Saxons:</hi> And in truth it is very like that great multitudes of <hi>Britains</hi> flying from the fury of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves to <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> as places moſt diſtant and more defenceable, and where they might expect better Conditions, and more advantage of reſiſting their new Maſters, then in other parts; for no doubt this Kingdom of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons</hi> was made up of more Provinces than <hi>Hampſhire</hi> or <hi>Somerſet,</hi> ſo that <hi>Cerdic</hi> had good footing in <hi>Devonſhire, Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire, Barkſhire</hi> and <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> to which ſhortly after was added the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> beſtow'd by <hi>Cerdic</hi> on his late arriv'd Kinſmen <hi>Stuffa</hi> and <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> who deſtroy'd the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Inhabitants there at <hi>Whitgarburg,</hi> ſo call'd from <hi>Whitgar,</hi> but now contractedly <hi>Caresburg.</hi> While <hi>Cerdic</hi> was buſie in eſtabliſhing his new Kingdom, in the year 520. <hi>Colgrin, Baldulf</hi> and <hi>Cheldric,</hi> whom King <hi>Arthur</hi> had lately ſubdu'd at <hi>York,</hi> and forc'd to abjure the land; returning, landed at <hi>Totneſs,</hi> from whence paſſing through <hi>Cerdic</hi>'s Dominions, they came to the City of <hi>Bath</hi> and Beſieg'd it. King <hi>Arthur</hi> hearing thereof, caus'd the Hoſtages which they had left to be Hang'd; and gathering a mighty Army, came to raiſe the Seige; where the Armies being joyn'd, he calling on the Name of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whoſe Image he wore over his Armour, ſlew great numbers of his Enemies, and amongſt the reſt, <hi>Colgrin</hi> and his Brother <hi>Baldulf,</hi> which <hi>Cheldric</hi> perceiving, fled, and was purſu'd by <hi>Cador</hi> the Duke of <hi>Cornwall</hi> to the Iſle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> and there ſlain by him, the reſt being forc'd to yield. King <hi>Arthur,</hi> as may be remembred, obtain'd a Battle before he was King near <hi>Bath</hi> at the Mountain <hi>Badonicus;</hi> now this is likely to be another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat given by King <hi>Arthur</hi> to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and the City of <hi>Bath</hi> being in the utmoſt extremity <hi>Weſt-ward</hi> of <hi>Cerdic</hi>'s Kingdom, it might at this time have been in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Britains.</hi> As for King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s invoking the aſſiſtance of our Bleſſed Lady in the Fight, it was a Devotion general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practic'd by the Church in this Age. For two years before, there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been Aſſembled two Councels in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> one at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the other at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Synod at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> wrote to the Biſhops of the other Councel thus, <hi>We beſeech you moſt Holy Biſhops, to Pray with us to our Lord for theſe things, for the Neceſſities of Gods Prieſts ought to be common; make your Supplications likewiſe with us to the most Holy and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>Mother of God, that ſhe would intercede for the Peace of the Catholick Church, and for the Victory and long Life of our moſt Excellent and Pious Emperour;</hi> The like practice we find elſe-where, of which many
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96414:74"/>Examples may be given: The next year King <hi>Arthur</hi> was call'd into the <hi>Northern</hi> parts to aſſiſt Prince <hi>Howel,</hi> who three years before was come out of <hi>Little Britain</hi> to his Aid, and was now Beſieg'd by the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> in the City call'd <hi>Acluid,</hi> wherein he lay Sick. Upon King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s approach, the Enemies retir'd to a place call'd <hi>Mureif</hi> whither he purſu'd them; but they eſcaping by night, fled to a Lake call'd <hi>Lumoney:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon King <hi>Arthur</hi> gathering many Ships together, encompaſs'd the Iſland, and in 15 days brought them to ſuch extreme Famine, that many thouſands of them Periſh'd: In which utmoſt danger the Biſhops of that Region came Barefoot to the King with Tears, beſeeching him, <hi>To take pitty of that miſerable People, and to give them ſome ſmall portion of that Country, to inhabit under the yoak of perpetual Servitude.</hi> The King thus mollify'd with the Tears of the Biſhops, pardon'd his Enemies, and granted their requeſt; Hence it is, that ſome Writers ground the ſubjection of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Brittain,</hi> and particularly <hi>Walſingham;</hi> but certainly better grounds may be found of it than this. Whereas it is ſaid, that certain <hi>Pictiſh</hi> and <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Biſhops were Supplicants to this King for their Diſtreſs'd Countrymen; it hath been already demonſtrated that the Province of the <hi>Picts,</hi> where the City of <hi>Acluid</hi> is ſeated, had many years before receiv'd the Chriſtian Faith by the Preaching of St. <hi>Ninianus;</hi> but who were his Succeſſors is hard to conjecture. In the Annals of <hi>Ireland,</hi> mention is made of a certain Biſhop call'd <hi>Nennion,</hi> who is ſaid to have flouriſh'd in <hi>Britain</hi> about the year 520. and to have had his ſeat in a place call'd the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery: This man probably was the Succeſſor of St. <hi>Ninianus,</hi> and that great Monaſtery the ſame with <hi>Candida Caſa,</hi> where the Monument of that Apoſtolick Biſhop was, which by reaſon of frequent Miracles wrought there, invited great numbers of Devout men to embrace a Caeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitical Life: Of this Biſhop <hi>Nennion</hi> we read in the Life of St. <hi>Finanus, That he having been in his Childhood inſtructed by St.</hi> Coleman, <hi>was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward recommended to the care of</hi> Nennion, <hi>when he came into</hi> Ireland, <hi>and return'd with</hi> Nennion <hi>into</hi> Scotland, <hi>and there Learn'd of him the Rules of a Monaſtical Life at his See, call'd the great Monaſtery. Finanus</hi> there alſo ſtudied the Holy Scriptures, and by invoking the Name of Chriſt, is ſaid to have wrought many Miracles. And having been thus inſtructed by <hi>Nennion,</hi> he took a Journey to the See Apoſtolick, there to ſupply his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in ſaving knowledge; ſeven years he continu'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> daily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing in Sacred Science, and then aſcended to the degree of Prieſthood. This <hi>Nennion</hi> in probability, was one of thoſe who interceded with King <hi>Arthur,</hi> and about the ſame time that St. <hi>Finanus</hi> liv'd under his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</p>
            <p>I ſhall paſs by the Death of <hi>Guenevera</hi> King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Wife, and his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Marriage with great Solemnities at the ſametime, with the Prodigious Victories aſcrib'd to him by ſome of our Writers in Forreign parts, and proceed to other tranſactions more probable occurring in his time.</p>
            <p>In the year 527. two new Kingdoms were Erected in <hi>Britain,</hi> without any diſturbance from King <hi>Arthur,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Provinces of <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Cambridgeſhire,</hi> the Kingdom of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles</hi> was Eſtabliſh'd, and in <hi>Midleſex</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi> the Kingdom of the <hi>Eaſt-Saxons:</hi> Which of theſe Kingdoms were firſt Erected, is uncertain; but both without doubt much about the ſame time. The firſt King of the <hi>Eaſt-Saxons,</hi> is believ'd to be <hi>Erkenwin</hi> the Son of <hi>Offa,</hi> and the Kingdom of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles,</hi> is thought
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96414:75"/>to begin under <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ffa,</hi> from whom the ſucceeding Kings were Antiently call'd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ffings:</hi> The year following the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> by the <hi>Britains</hi> call'd <hi>Guith,</hi> which ſignifies a divorce or renting aſunder, and by the <hi>Saxons Witland,</hi> was Conquer'd by King <hi>Cerdic,</hi> and given to his Nephews <hi>Stuffa</hi> and <hi>Whitgar:</hi> But while <hi>Cerdic</hi> buſied himſelf about the Invaſion of the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> St. <hi>David</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Menevia</hi> Aſſembled a Provincial Synod, call'd the Synod of Victory, wherein all the Clergy of <hi>Wales</hi> or <hi>Cambria</hi> met together, and confirm'd the former Decrees of the Synod of <hi>Brevy,</hi> and added new ones for the Churches benefit; from which two Synods all the Churches of <hi>Cambria</hi> receiv'd their Eccleſiaſtical Orders, which alſo were confirm'd by the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: Theſe Decrees were committed to Writing with his own hand, and reſerv'd in his own Church, the Copies thereof being communicated to other Churches in that Province, all which with many other Treaſures of that Noble Library furniſh'd by him, have been loſt, partly by Age and Negligence, but principally by the Incurſions of Pirats, who, from the Iſles of <hi>Orkney,</hi> every <hi>Summer</hi> us'd to waſte the Sea-Coaſts of <hi>Cambria:</hi> This loſs indeed is to be deplor'd, ſince by thoſe Records we might have perfectly underſtood the ſtate of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches: However, we are aſſur'd that thoſe Churches were regulated according to the <hi>Roman,</hi> and practic'd the ſame both in Doctrine and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and conſequently, that St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſent after to Convert the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> brought no Novelties with him, ſince St. <hi>Gregory</hi> who ſent him, was exalted to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, not above 60 years after this Synod. It is written in the Life of St. <hi>Kined, That when St.</hi> David <hi>had publiſh'd his Edicts for aſſembling this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Councel of</hi> Cambria, <hi>he humbly invited St.</hi> Kined <hi>to it; who excus'd his not coming, in regard, that for his ſins, he was become diſtorted and crooked in his Body; and was beſides unable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſuch a Journey: Whereupon it is ſaid, that St.</hi> Kined <hi>by the Prayers of St.</hi> David, <hi>was reſtor'd to Heath and ſtraightneſs; and by his own Prayers reduc'd again to his Infirmity and Crookedneſs.</hi> Whether this were ſo or no, certain it is, that this St. <hi>Kined</hi> fill'd <hi>Britain</hi> with the fame of his Sanctity: He liv'd a Solitary Anachoretical Life in the Province now call'd <hi>Glamorganſhire;</hi> probably in the ſame place where yet remains a Chappel, call'd St. <hi>Keneth</hi>'s Chappel, left as a Monument of his Sanctity, as <hi>Cambden</hi> witneſſes. The Celebrating this Synod, is the laſt publick Action we find recorded of St. <hi>David.</hi> He would not accept of Metropolitical Juriſdiction, but upon condition, that he might transfer the See from <hi>Caerleon</hi> to <hi>Menevia,</hi> a place of Remoteneſs and Solitude; and in the Neighbourhood of many Saints and Religious Perſons in the Iſlands and Territory adjoyning, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt acceptable to him: Which Tranſlation was approv'd by King <hi>Arthur</hi> and the Synod not then diſſolv'd: This <hi>Menevia</hi> is ſeated in the Province of the <hi>Dimetae,</hi> now <hi>Pembrokeſhire,</hi> adjoyning to the moſt remote Province of <hi>Britain,</hi> where the Soyl is Stony and Barren, neither Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Wood, nor interlac'd with Rivers, nor adorn'd with Meadows, but expos'd to the Sun and Windes; yet with this Penury the Antient Saints and Biſhops were beſt contented, accounting the remoteneſs from Worldly Tumults and noiſe, to recompenſe ſufficiently all ſuch Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. This <hi>Menevia,</hi> or as the <hi>Britains</hi> call'd it <hi>Menew,</hi> was in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Holy Biſhop nam'd by the Converted <hi>Saxons, David Minſter,</hi> and by the <hi>Britains, Twy Davy,</hi> that is, <hi>David's Houſe,</hi> and at this day, St. <hi>Davids:</hi> The Biſhop whereof, was for many Ages the Metropolitan
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96414:75"/>of <hi>Cambria,</hi> but at length became ſubject to <hi>Canterbury:</hi> Notwithſtanding the Inhabitants of <hi>Wales</hi> ſince the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt commenc'd a Suit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for their former Right and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, but the Cauſe was judg'd againſt them. The Paſtoral care and Zeal of St. <hi>David</hi> in maintaining the Catholick Faith againſt <hi>Hereſies,</hi> eſpecially againſt <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> and Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline againſt Vices and Diſorders, was ſignally approv'd, and manifeſted in the Synod of <hi>Victory,</hi> Aſſembled by him ten years after his Conſecration: Neither was this his Paſtoral care confin'd to his own Province, but extended it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad alſo, even to <hi>Ireland,</hi> from whence he was often viſited and conſulted by Devout men. In thoſe days it was a frequent cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi>-men to go in Pilgrimage, and their Devotion was to viſit the Monuments of the Apoſtles in <hi>Rome:</hi> Amongſt the reſt, one <hi>Barro,</hi> an Abbot in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Cork,</hi> went thither, and in his return, paſs'd by <hi>Menevia,</hi> where he ſtaid for the accommodation of a Ship and Wind. And indeed it was the practice of Devout <hi>Iriſh</hi>-men, either in their going or returning, to ſeek the Converſation of the Holy Biſhop <hi>David,</hi> whoſe Name like a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fragrant Oyntment, was ſpread all abroad: It appears by Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>'s Catalogue, that <hi>Iriſh</hi> Saints were to be ſorted into ſeveral Orders, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the times wherein they liv'd.</p>
            <p>The firſt Order, <hi>Was of ſuch as liv'd either Contemporaries with St.</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick, <hi>or preſently after him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Order, <hi>Contain'd ſuch Saints as liv'd about this Age; ſuch as were St.</hi> Finanus, <hi>call'd by the</hi> Iriſh, Fin, <hi>and by the</hi> Britains Gain <hi>or</hi> Win, <hi>St.</hi> Brendon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid the Saints of the ſecond Order receiv'd the right Order of Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating <hi>Maſs</hi> out of <hi>Britain,</hi> from Holy men there living, as St. <hi>David,</hi> St. <hi>Gildas</hi> and St. <hi>Doc:</hi> Moreover, St. <hi>David</hi> ſent over ſome of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples into <hi>Ireland,</hi> who grew famous for their Learning and Sanctity, of whom the moſt Illuſtrious was St. <hi>Aedan,</hi> call'd by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> St. <hi>Madoc.</hi> After he grew renown'd for his Piety and Miracles, he built at length a Monaſtery near the City of <hi>Fernes,</hi> where having collected a great number of Devout Brethren; he Conſecrated himſelf to the Service of God, living according to the form and rule which he had receiv'd from his Pious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther St. <hi>David,</hi> the ſame which was obſerv'd by the Monks in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> This St. <hi>Aedan</hi> was afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Fernes</hi> and Metropolitan of <hi>Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> while St. <hi>David</hi> liv'd, whom he us'd to conſult in Affairs of difficulty. After many years ſpent by the Holy Biſhop <hi>David</hi> in the exerciſe of all Chriſtian Virtues, it pleas'd Almighty God in love to him, and juſt anger to the Ungrateful <hi>Britains,</hi> to tranſlate this burning and ſhining Light from Earth to Heaven, there to ſhine in Glory to all Eternity: According to the beſt account. He dy'd in the year of Grace 544. having liv'd 82 years, though ſome writers affirm him to have liv'd much longer. It is ſaid, <hi>That when the hour of his Diſſolution approach'd, the Angel of the Lord appear'd to him, ſaying,</hi> The day ſo much deſir'd by thee, is now at hand; prepare thy ſelf, for on the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, attended with a multitude of Angels, will come to meet thee; <hi>Whereupon the Holy man of God ſaid,</hi> O Lord diſmiſs now thy Servant in Peace: <hi>The Brethren who aſſiſted him, having heard the ſound of theſe words, but not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſenſe, fell Proſtrate to the ground in great fear: Then the Holy Biſhop cry'd with a loud voice,</hi> Lord Jeſus Chriſt receive my Spirit: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96414:76"/>this the Brethren pour'd forth loud Complaints, but he aſſwag'd their ſorrow with mild and comfortable words, exhorting them to be conſtant in their good profeſſion, and unanimouſly to bear to the end that yoak which they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, and to obſerve and fulfill whatever they had ſeen or heard from him; and from that hour, to the day of his death, he remain'd in the Church, exhorting and encouraging them. But when the hour of his departure was come, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt vouchſafed his preſence, as he had promis'd by his Angel, to the infinite Conſolation of the Holy Father; who at the Heavenly ſight, exalted in Spirit, cry'd out,</hi> O my Lord take me after thee; <hi>With which words in our Lords company, he gave up his Spirit to God, upon the</hi> Calends <hi>fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd; and being aſſociated to a troop of Angels, mounted up to Heaven with them.</hi> The Death of this Holy Biſhop, is ſaid to have been divulg'd by an Angel, and in an Inſtant ſpread through all <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> That this was ſo, ſeems to be confirm'd by a paſſage in the Life of St. <hi>Kentigern,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>That having one day continu'd his Prayers with more then ordinary Devotion, his face ſeem'd as on fire, the ſight whereof fill'd the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders with great amazement; when Prayers were ended, the Saint began to lament bitterly, and when his Diſciples demanded a reaſon of his ſorrow, he ſate a while ſilent, and at laſt ſaid, My dear Children, know for certain that the Holy Biſhop</hi> David, <hi>the Glory of</hi> Britain, <hi>the Father of his Country, is this day dead, he has eſcap'd out of the Priſon of his Body, and is flown to Heaven: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, I my ſelf have ſeen a multitude of Angels conducting him into the Joy of our Lord; and our Lord himſelf at the Entrance of Paradice, hath Crown'd him with Glory and Honour. Know alſo, that</hi> Britain, <hi>which is depriv'd of ſo great a Light, will a long time mourn for the Abſence of ſuch a Patron, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd himſelf to the Sword of our Lord when it was half drawn out, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of that Nation, in revenge of their Sins and Impenitence: Now will God deliver up</hi> Britain <hi>to a ſtrange Nation which know him not, and</hi> Pagans <hi>ſhall enjoy the land of its Inhabitants: Chriſtian Religion ſhall be utterly diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated in it, 'till the time prefix'd by God be ended. But after that, it ſhall through the Mercies of our Lord, be reſtor'd to its former ſtate; yea to a far better and more Happy.</hi> St. <hi>David</hi> was Buried in his own Church of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevia,</hi> which he had lov'd above all Monaſteries of his Dioceſs; becauſe St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> who had Propheſied of his Nativity, had been Founder of it: And alſo indeed he was bury'd there by the command of <hi>Malgo</hi> King of the <hi>Venedatae:</hi> But after 500 years he was Solemnly Canoniz'd by <hi>Pope Calixtus</hi> the ſecond. This Church at firſt was Dedicated to St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> but after took St. <hi>David</hi> for its Patron, and the whole Dioceſs was thence call'd St. <hi>David</hi>'s. The memory of his Sanctity was ſo precious, that within a few years after his Death, the viſiting of his Church prov'd a great Devotion of thoſe times; St. <hi>Oudoceus</hi> Succeſſor of St. <hi>Thelian</hi> in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Landaff,</hi> after a Pilgrimage to viſit the Monuments of the Holy Apoſtles at <hi>Rome,</hi> made another to this Church of St. <hi>David;</hi> and after, when any one had a deſire to go in Devotion to <hi>Rome,</hi> and was hindred by dangers or difficulties, he might equal the merit of ſuch a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage by twice viſiting this Church of St. <hi>David;</hi> perhaps as a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation allow'd by the <hi>Pope:</hi> St. <hi>Kinoc</hi> or <hi>Cenac</hi> was St. <hi>David</hi>'s Succeſſor, tranſlated thither from the See of St. <hi>Patern;</hi> of whom, and other Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in the See of St. <hi>David</hi> little is found: To keep the ſtory of this worthy Biſhop entire, ſome interruption may be obſerv'd to have been made in the order of Time. It is therefore requiſite to return to its due courſe.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The firſt Canon of the Apoſtles, confirm'd by many Councels, enjoyns, <hi>That every Biſhop ſhould be Ordain'd by at leaſt two or three Biſhops:</hi> Whereas St. <hi>Kentigern</hi> was Conſecrated by one ſingle Biſhop, who was a Stranger of a Forreign Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In the Conſecration of Biſhops, the Antient Fathers for the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of that Degree, ordain'd many Rites to be obſerv'd, beſide ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Eſſence of that Sacrament, <hi>As Anointing the Head with Chriſm, with Invocation of the Holy Spirit, Signing the Perſon with the Sign of the Croſs, Impoſitionof Hands;</hi> Together with ſeveral other Rites adjoyned for the Adorning the Houſe of God, the defect whereof did not vitiate the Sacrament, but the Perſon only.</p>
            <p>Now in all theſe Points ſome Defects there were in the Ordination of St. <hi>Kentigern,</hi> which when he afterwards call'd to mind, caus'd great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs and remorſe in him; a Cuſtom introduc'd among <hi>Britains,</hi> to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain thus imperfectly, crept in ſince the Diſturbances made by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> ſo as the Eccleſiaſtical Canons were either forgotten, or render'd unpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, for that there were no Metropolitans, or at ſuch diſtance, that they could not be had, moſt places wanting not only Biſhops, but Inhabitants; and it is probable in the preſent caſe the very <hi>Chriſme</hi> was furniſh'd out of <hi>Ireland.</hi> It therefore is manifeſt, that theſe Diſorders were excuſeable, becauſe unavoidable: But in Peaceable times the practice was otherwiſe, and the Canons were duly obſerv'd, and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Faith unblemiſh'd. And by this we may ſee, that the <hi>Britains</hi> in their Ordinations before St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s time, conform'd themſelves to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and not to the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96414:77"/>
               <hi>Eaſtern,</hi> as ſome would collect; for in truth no <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church can be found, which neglected any of theſe Ceremonies. However, to be ſure the <hi>Britains</hi> in their Diſcipline eſtabliſh'd by Councels, demanded a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from the See Apoſtolick: And this appears by the Demeanor of St. <hi>Kentigern</hi> himſelf; for being after afflicted in mind, for thoſe Defects in his Ordination, he ſought not Council from any Metropolitan, but from the Supreme Biſhop in <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom the cuſtody of Eccleſiaſtical Canons was committed, and who had Authority to enjoyn the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, and puniſh, and regulate the neglect: Therefore St. <hi>Kentigern,</hi> as we find recorded, went ſeveral times to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he candidly laid open his Life, his Election, Conſecration, and all the circumſtances of it to St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſpecial Apoſtle of the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> Upon which the Holy <hi>Pope</hi> perceiving, that he was a ſincere man of God, confirm'd his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, knowing it came from God. Moreover, at the earneſt requeſt of St. <hi>Kentigern,</hi> though with ſome unwillingneſs, he condeſcended to ſupply thoſe ſmall defects, which were in his Conſecration, and ſo diſmiſt him to the work of his Miniſtry enjoyn'd him by the Holy-Ghoſt. So that it appears nothing eſſentially neceſſary in this Conſecration was omitted, becauſe the Holy <hi>Pope</hi> ſupply'd the defects meerly upon importunity. The greateſt fault the Holy Biſhop could impute to himſelf, was his being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated by one only Biſhop againſt the expreſs Canon of a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel; though indeed conſidering the danger and unquietneſs of the times, if the words of the Canon were tranſgreſs'd, yet the intent was not, as not obliging to Impoſſibilities: And this ſenſe of the Canon appears by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> to St. <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> That he being the only Biſhop in the Church of the <hi>Angli,</hi> might himſelf alone ordain other Biſhops. It is ſaid of this St. <hi>Kentigern, That during the whole courſe of his Life, his cuſtom was to eat only every third day, and ſometimes every fourth; his food was Bread, Milk, Cheeſe and Butter: He always abſtain'd from Fleſh and Wine, or any other Drink which could Diſtemper. Next his skin he wore a very rough Hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath, and over that a Garment made of Goat-skins, together with a cloſe Cowle, and his uppermoſt cloathing was a white Albe. He always wore a Stole, and carried a Paſtoral Staff or Croſier, not Spherical, Gilded or ſet with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, but of ſimple Wood, bowing back at the Top; and in his Hand he ever held a Book, thus was he always in readineſs to exerciſe his Function, whenever neceſſity or reaſon requir'd: He lay in a ſtone Cheſt made hollow like a Biere; under his Head lay a ſtone, and under his body were caſt Cinders and Cilice of Hair; in which poſture with ſome unwillingneſs, he admitted a ſhort ſleep; after which he would plunge himſelf into Cold Water, and ſo recite the whole Pſalter: This practice neither Snow nor Rain interrupted, nor any thing but Sickneſs, or Journeying: He ſix'd his Epiſcopal See in the City of</hi> Glaſco, <hi>where he alſo ordain'd a great Congregation of Religious men, who liv'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the form of the Primitive Church, in community of all things: The</hi> Infidels <hi>in his Dioceſs, he converted to the Faith,</hi> Apoſtates <hi>and</hi> Hereticks <hi>by his ſound Doctrine he reduc'd to the boſome of our Holy Mother the Church. He every where threw down Idols and Images of Devils, and built ſome Churches: He diſtinguiſh'd Pariſhes by their certain bounds: He was always travelling to gain Souls to God; never riding, but in imitation of the Apoſtles, always going on foot; And becauſe he would not eat his Bread in Idleneſs, his cuſtom was to labour with his hands in Agriculture.</hi>

            <pb n="150" facs="tcp:96414:78"/>
            <p>About this time our famous King <hi>Arthur,</hi> upon ſome unknown occaſion Abroad, left the Adminiſtration of his Kingdom to his Nephew <hi>Mordred,</hi> Son of <hi>Loth</hi> King of the <hi>Picts</hi> by his Siſter; <hi>Mordred</hi> in the Abſence of his Uncle, invades his Throne, upon pretence King <hi>Arthur</hi> was a Baſtard, and born out of Lawful Marriage: To this Treaſon the Traytor adds the Crime of Inceſt, violently taking his Uncles Wife Queen <hi>Guenhumara:</hi> And to ſtrengthen himſelf, he enter'd into a Confederacy with the King of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons,</hi> to whom he yielded up ſeveral Provinces. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Crime ſoon brings King <hi>Arthur</hi> back into <hi>Britain,</hi> inflam'd with rage againſt his abominable Kinſman. <hi>Mordred</hi> was prepared to hinder his landing, where a Cruel Battle was fought between them, in which <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſelus</hi> King of <hi>Albania,</hi> and <hi>Walwan</hi> another Nephew of King <hi>Arthur</hi> were ſlain; notwithſtanding which, at laſt King <hi>Arthur</hi> with infinite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty landed, and renewing the Fight, made a great ſlaughter of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, compelling <hi>Mordred</hi> to fly to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> whither he was purſu'd by King <hi>Arthur;</hi> where in a ſecond Battle, after much Blood-ſhed, he was again put to flight toward <hi>Cornwall:</hi> But King <hi>Arthur</hi> not ceaſing to follow, at laſt overtook him near the River <hi>Camblan,</hi> where <hi>Mordred</hi> having rang'd his Forces, in a deſperate fury ruſh'd amongſt his Enemies, reſolv'd rather to die, then once more to ſhew his back to them. In this Combat, which continu'd almoſt a whole day, after horrible Bloodſhed on both ſides, King <hi>Arthur</hi> with the Courage and fury of a Lyon, ruſh'd into the Troop where he knew <hi>Mordred</hi> was, and making way with his Sword, at laſt with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſlaughter diſpers'd the Enemies: There fell the Traytor <hi>Mordred,</hi> and with him ſeveral <hi>Saxon</hi> Commanders, <hi>Elaphius, Egbrith</hi> and <hi>Bruning</hi> and many thouſands with them: But this Victory coſt King <hi>Arthur</hi> his Life, for in the Combat he receiv'd a Mortal Wound, and was convey'd by the Charity of a Kins-woman of his, a Noble Matron call'd <hi>Morganis,</hi> into the Iſland of <hi>Avallonia,</hi> now <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> which gave occaſion to the fooliſh <hi>Britiſh Bards</hi> to invent the Story, <hi>Of</hi> Morganis <hi>a Faery Goddeſs, who carried the Body of King</hi> Arthur <hi>into</hi> Avallonia <hi>by Magick skill, with promiſe to Cure his Wounds, and that he ſhould return with his former Strength and Courage to govern the</hi> Britains; Who for many Ages expected his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, as fooliſhly as the coming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is look'd for by the <hi>Jews.</hi> When <hi>Guenhumara</hi> heard of her Husbands return, ſhe fled to the City of <hi>Caerleon,</hi> and there took the Habit of a Religious Woman among the Nuns in the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Julius</hi> the Martyr: The true reaſon why King <hi>Arthur</hi> would be carried to the Monaſtery of <hi>Glaſtonbury</hi> doubtleſs was, partly to prepare himſelf more perfectly for Death in the company, and by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Monks there; and that after his death he might be bury'd among ſuch a world of Saints as repos'd there from the beginning of Chriſtianity: The like we read of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who for the like purpoſe was bury'd in like manner, <hi>That he might have the Prayers of ſuch as in ſucceeding Ages ſhould come to viſit thoſe Monuments:</hi> King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi> before his death gave to that Monaſtery, <hi>Brent, March, Poulden</hi> and other Lands beſides, which the <hi>Pagan Angli</hi> took away; but after being Converted to the Faith, reſtor'd with Advantage. King <hi>Arthur</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his Succeſſor a Kins-man of his call'd <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended himſelf to the Prayers of the Monks, he dy'd Happily, and after a Chriſtian manner was bury'd with a <hi>Croſs.</hi> His conveyance to <hi>Glaſtonbury</hi> was it ſeems by his own Order, and done with all Secreſie, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96414:78"/>by like order his Death and place of Burial ſtudiouſly conceal'd. <hi>For,</hi> (ſays <hi>Matthew Paris) the King dying, was deſirous to be hidden, leaſt his Enemies ſhould inſult, and his Friends be moleſted at ſo great a Calamity. Hence it is that Hiſtories relate little or nothing of his Death and Burial; Inſomuch, as the</hi> Britiſh <hi>Nation out of their Affection to him, contend that he is ſtill alive; upon which occaſion the Prophecy was invented and father'd upon</hi> Merlin, <hi>That he ſhould appear and reign once more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems in the year of Grace 1142. the Sepulchre of King <hi>Arthur</hi> could no where be found; whereas the Sepulchre of his Heroick Nephew <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> had then lately been found in the time of King <hi>William</hi> near the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt, and was 14 Foot long: But a while after, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the II. by the induſtry of certain Devout perſons King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument was found, and the expectation of his return thereby vaniſh'd among the <hi>Welch</hi> People: The manner how it was found, is ſet forth by many Authors; one of which affirms, <hi>That the Abbot who found it, ſhew'd him the Croſs which lay over King</hi> Arthur<hi>'s Body, the Characters whereof he read:</hi> But we may receive the moſt Authentick account of this from the great Table of <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> fram'd on purpoſe to preſerve the memory of this Invention, wherein it is thus written, <hi>In this Iſland</hi> Avallonia, <hi>or rather this Tomb of Saints at</hi> Glaſtonbury; <hi>do reſt King</hi> Arthur, <hi>the flower of the Kings of</hi> Britain, <hi>and</hi> Guenhavera <hi>his Queen, who after their Deceaſe were Honourably Bury'd near the Old Church, between two Stone Pyramids, heretofore Nobly Engraven; and in the ſame place have their Bodies reſted for many years, to wit,</hi> 628. <hi>years, untill the time of</hi> Henry de Soili, <hi>who after the burning of the ſaid Church, was Abbot there: This Abbot after many admonitions by ſeveral perſons, commanded men to dig between the ſaid Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids: They dig'd exceeding deep, and at laſt found a very great Bier of Wood ſhut cloſe up, which, with their Inſtruments they open'd, and within it diſcover'd the Kings Body, and a Croſs of Lead, one whole ſide whereof was fill'd with this Inſcription,</hi> Here lyes Bury'd the famous King <hi>Arthur</hi> in the Iſland of Aval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia: <hi>Then they open'd the Tomb of the Queen, and the Hairs of her Head were ſpread over her Body, and ſeem'd as if ſhe had been but lately bury'd; but as ſoon as they touch'd them, they fell all into Duſt. The Abbot then and Convent with great Joy, and exceeding Honour, transfer'd their Bodies from thence, and plac'd them in a double Monument of Stone Nobly Engraven on the one ſide in the great Church, to wit, The Kings Body by it ſelf at the Head of the Tomb, and the Queens on the</hi> Eaſt-ſide. Theſe Teſtimonies are enough to declare the unreaſonableneſs of ſome late aſſertions, that there never was any ſuch man; That many fooliſh ſtories paſs concerning him, cannot be deny'd; but that it may be collected from St. <hi>Bede,</hi> that there never was any ſuch man, is a miſtake; all that he ſays, is, <hi>That</hi> Ambroſius Aurelius <hi>a Modeſt man, was the only perſon of the</hi> Roman <hi>Stock, who over-liv'd the Miſeries of the</hi> Britains, <hi>at the time when the</hi> Saxons <hi>rais'd ſuch Tragedies in the Iſland;</hi> He denies not that he had Sons and Grand-children: On the contrary, <hi>Gildas</hi> expreſly affirms, <hi>That the Off-ſpring of</hi> Ambroſius <hi>in the times when he wrote, did degenerate from the Virtue of their Anceſtors:</hi> It cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be deny'd, that ſuch a Prince govern'd the <hi>Britains</hi> as King <hi>Arthur,</hi> that he reign'd about 33 years, that he dy'd in the 70th. year of his Age, and was bury'd after the Chriſtian manner, as was ſufficiently teſtify'd by the <hi>Croſs</hi> over his Tomb; which Croſs was from the beginning eſteem'd through the whole Church, an aſſur'd Badge of Chriſtianity: The firſt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:96414:79"/>degree of Apoſtacy declar'd by <hi>Julian,</hi> was the caſting away the Sign of the Croſs, which ſaith St. <hi>Cyril, Is the prime and immoveable Foundation of the Faith profeſs'd by Chriſtians, and with which</hi> Athanaſius, <hi>hath in every Age triumph'd over all Superſtition and Idolatry:</hi> Whereas of late the <hi>Croſs</hi> it ſelf is now accounted Superſtitious. Before we come to ſhew how far the Succeſſor of King <hi>Arthur</hi> degenerated from him, ſomething muſt be ſaid of two famous men of that Age, St. <hi>Iltutus,</hi> and St. <hi>Sampſon;</hi> the former dy'd during the reign of that Heroical King: He was the Son of a Noble Souldier Nam'd <hi>Rican,</hi> his Mother was call'd <hi>Rieneguilida,</hi> Daughter to a Prince of <hi>Little-Britain.</hi> In his Childhood he was inſtructed in Learning, but arriving to more years, he apply'd himſelf to Martial Affairs; and hearing of the Magnanimity of his Kins-man King <hi>Arthur,</hi> he went to viſit him; after he apply'd himſelf to the Prince of <hi>Glamorganſhire,</hi> of whom he became ſo highly eſteem'd, that he advanc'd him to the higheſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that State next himſelf: After this he was Councell'd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by St. <hi>Cadocus</hi> to forſake the Secular Habit and Profeſſion, and to Conſecrate the remainder of his Life to the Service of God, that he might the more aſſuredly obtain Eternal Rewards and Happineſs. <hi>Iltutus</hi> ſubmitting to the Councel of the Holy man, relinquiſh'd the World, and retiring to a commodious Manſion, liv'd there ſome time a Solitary and Devout Life: Then he had recourſe to St. <hi>Dubritius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> from whom he receiv'd the Tonſure and Crown, Badges of a Religious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; And thus with the Conſent of his Wife vow'd perpetual Chaſtity, which ſhe alſo obſerv'd: How the Centuriatours of <hi>Magdeburg</hi> have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted themſelves in the relation of this Saint, muſt be referr'd to their Writings: Sure it is the memory of his Learning and Sanctity, is preſerv'd to this day in <hi>Glamorganſhire,</hi> where there is a Town and Church call'd <hi>Llanlivit,</hi> or <hi>Llaniltut,</hi> (not far from <hi>Llancarvan</hi> the habitation of St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docus,</hi>) where St. <hi>Iltutus</hi> diligently Preach'd Gods word, and inſtituted a Colledge of Schollars, which he inſtructed in Learning and Piety; amongſt whom the moſt Illuſtrious was the fore-nam'd St. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who by his Maſters direction embrac'd alſo a Religious profeſſion, of whom more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of this St. <hi>Iltutus,</hi> that he was the Diſciple of St. <hi>Germanus,</hi> and had the Spirit of Prophecy: As for his Diſciple St. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> he was born in <hi>South-wales</hi> of Noble Parents, after they had liv'd long Childleſs; his Fathers Name was <hi>Amon,</hi> and his Mothers <hi>Anne:</hi> He was inſtructed in Humane knowledge, Integrity of Life, and a Monaſtical Inſtitution by St. <hi>Iltutus,</hi> and liv'd in a Monaſtery built by a Holy man call'd <hi>Piro,</hi> in an Iſland not far diſtant from the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Iltutus,</hi> and there is ſaid to had led a perfect and Angelical Life, <hi>Amiable in his Converſation, Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant in Prayer, and Perſevering in good Works.</hi> Not long after by the Death of <hi>Piro,</hi> this Holy man <hi>Sampſon</hi> was unanimouſly choſen Abbot: Four years after his Election, by the permiſſion of St. <hi>Dubritius,</hi> he went into <hi>Ireland,</hi> but his ſtay was not long there, for he was preſent at the Councel of <hi>Brevi:</hi> He was after ordain'd an Arch-biſhop in <hi>Britain,</hi> but it cannot be aſſign'd of what place, only it is without doubt reported, that St. <hi>Sampſon</hi> a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Arch-biſhop went over into <hi>Little Britain,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him the Pall, Enſign of his Dignity: Great diſpute hath riſen whether this St. <hi>Sampſon</hi> were Arch-biſhop of <hi>York</hi> or <hi>Menevia;</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſeems to have been concluded to the advantage of <hi>Menevia,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:96414:79"/>St. <hi>Sampſon</hi> is ſuppos'd to have ſucceeded <hi>Kinocus,</hi> who was next to St. <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Church of <hi>Menevia</hi> enjoying all the Priviledges of the Church of <hi>Caerleon,</hi> muſt needs be Metropolitan, and conſequently the Archbiſhop thereof wore a Pall, which he probably carried over with him to <hi>Dole</hi> in <hi>Little Britain</hi> in the year of Grace 566. when the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Menevia</hi> was almoſt depopulated by a raging Peſtilential Diſeaſe; to avoid which, by the importunity of his Friends, he undertook that Voyage. Being arriv'd there, he was admitted into great Favour by <hi>Childebert</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and with his Licenſe and Contribution Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Monaſtery there, where he led a Holy Life, imploy'd in Divine Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation; and by his Pious Example and Admonitions, directed many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the ſame way. St. <hi>Sampſon</hi> in this Voyage took with him a Companion of ſuitable Holineſs, call'd St. <hi>Conaid,</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> vulgarly St. <hi>Mein,</hi> ſaid to be the Son of a Noble <hi>Britain,</hi> living near <hi>Caer Guent,</hi> and recommended to the care of St. <hi>Sampſon.</hi> One ſpecial Miracle is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to have been wrought by St. <hi>Mein,</hi> viz. <hi>That by his Prayers a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſprang forth in a dry Soyl, very effectual for Curing ſeveral Diſeaſes,</hi> Eſpecially the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> there call'd the Diſeaſe of St. <hi>Mein:</hi> After St. <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> had ſpent ſome years in the Monaſtery of <hi>Dole,</hi> the Biſhop of that City dying, he was Elected in his place, and made uſe of his Pall there, from whence his Succeſſor in <hi>Dole,</hi> aſſum'd the Honour of wearing a Pall, and conſequently challenging Arch-Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, and an exemption from the Metropolitan of <hi>Tours.</hi> This continu'd 'till the days of <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. and all that time the See of St. <hi>David</hi>'s, though own'd the Prime Church of <hi>Wales,</hi> yet abſtain'd from the Pall; for which cauſe <hi>Eugenius</hi> the III. under King <hi>Henry</hi> the I. ſubjected it to the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the year of our Lord 1148. 33 years St. <hi>Sampſom</hi> with admirable Sanctity adminiſtred that Biſhoprick, and in the year 599. receiv'd his Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: His Body by reaſon of the frequent Incurſions of the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> was remov'd from <hi>Dole</hi> to <hi>Orleans,</hi> where it was receiv'd with ſuch Reverence, that a Church was built on purpoſe to keep it, which to this day is Dedicated to his Honour; although deſtitute of that Sacred Pledge, which among many other Bodies of Saints, was Impiouſly burn'd by thoſe profeſs'd Enemies of Sacred things, the <hi>Huguenots</hi> in the laſt Age, who ſeiz'd on that City: Some part of his Relicks was with great Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration repos'd in the Abbey of <hi>Middleton</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> which was built by King <hi>Ethelſtan</hi> in expiation of being at leaſt acceſſary to the Murder of his Brother <hi>Edwin</hi> in the year 934. His Succeſſor in the See of <hi>Dole</hi> was his Kinſman and Companion in his Voyage. St. <hi>Magbore</hi> another Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of St. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> call'd St. <hi>Maclovius</hi> or St. <hi>Malo,</hi> otherwiſe St. <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutus,</hi> was famous at that time. He, during the Tempeſt in <hi>Britain,</hi> by the reaſon of <hi>Mordred,</hi> paſs'd likewiſe into <hi>Little Britain,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon refuge of Devout men in thoſe times: He was born in <hi>Britain,</hi> his Fathers Name was <hi>Went.</hi> His Mother was call'd <hi>Derwella</hi> or <hi>Darwalla,</hi> being 60 years of Age when ſhe was deliver'd of him in the Valley of <hi>Elan Carvan</hi> in <hi>Glamorganſhire.</hi> In the ſame place then liv'd a Holy man, call'd St <hi>Brenden,</hi> Abbot of the Monaſtery of <hi>Elan Carvan,</hi> by whom this Infant thus wonderfully born was Baptiz'd, and after Educated in all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Piety: From his Childhood he is reported to have ſhin'd Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly by innumerable Miracles, which accompanied him all his Life-time:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96414:80"/>Our Learned <hi>Cambden</hi> affirms, <hi>That the conſtant Tradition was, that he was after made a Biſhop of a City in the Province of the</hi> Iceni, <hi>now</hi> Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donſhire, <hi>call'd</hi> Duroſipons, <hi>after</hi> Gormonceſter <hi>from</hi> Gormon <hi>or</hi> Guthrum <hi>the</hi> Dane, <hi>to whom becoming a Chriſtian, King</hi> Alfred <hi>gave thoſe Provinces.</hi> St. <hi>Malo</hi> upon occaſion of the troubles at that time, went into <hi>Little Britain</hi> alſo, where he liv'd in great Sanctity and contemning his own Glory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd privily into a Bodering Iſland, where in his Eremetical manner of living, he expreſs'd an Angelical Purity. But the brightneſs of the Divine Splendour diſcover'd this Light, which endeavour'd to conceal it ſelf. For when the Inhabitants of the Iſland, underſtood that a ſtranger excelling in the Gift of Preaching, and Power of Divine Miracles hid himſelf there from the Converſation of men, they in common Aſſembly came, and drawing him by force out of his Solitude, choſe him for their Paſtor, and inviting the neighbouring Biſhops, placed him in the Pontifical Chair of <hi>Aleth,</hi> and partly by entreaties and partly by force, compell'd him to be their Biſhop. The Saint being thus exalted, ſhed forth abundantly the Beams of that Divine Grace wherewith he was repleniſh'd, illuſtrating mens Souls with the true knowledge of God, inflaming them with his love, and affording both Admonitions and Examples of all Virtues; to which he added a great efficacy, by wonderful Operations and Miracles: Inſomuch, as ſince the Apoſtles times, we read not of any one, who wrought greater wonders than he. <hi>For with his word he calm'd Tempeſts, he reſtor'd three dead perſons to Life, to the Blind he gave Sight, by the ſprinkling of Holy Water he expell'd Devils and quench'd the Poiſon of Serpents:</hi> Neither did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble thoſe Princes of our Faith in working of Miracles only, but in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience alſo, to the tryal whereof he was often put; for he was Aſſaulted by certain Impious perſons, and ſuffer'd many Calamities for Religion and Juſtice, ſo as at laſt he was violently thruſt out of his Epiſcopal Throne and Dioceſs with ſeven other Devout perſons, his moſt eſpecial Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who imitated him in Purity of living. Yet did he bear this heavy Croſs after our Lord with a Courageous mind. Attended with theſe Holy men St. <hi>Mahutus</hi> fled into <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and in the City of <hi>Xaintes</hi> was moſt kindly entertain'd and Fatherly aſſiſted by St. <hi>Leontius</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> and Metropolitan of <hi>Xaintes,</hi> who there accomodated him with a convenient Habitation for ſerving God: St. <hi>Leontius</hi> bare a tender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, Admiring and Reverencing the Divine Grace which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in him, eſteeming him as ſent from Heaven to aſſiſt him in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Charge; for which reaſon in all his Viſitations, he took him for his Companion, entreating his Councels and Prayers. Howbeit the man of God, though he were ſo deſpitefully and unjuſtly exil'd, was not unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his Flock, but forgetting all Injuries, daily invok'd our Lords Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency for the Converſion of that ſtubborn People: The Divine Majeſty condeſcended to his Prayers, and by an Angel did acquaint him, <hi>That his Flock was Penitent, and deſir'd his return; that he ſhould repair to them, and reſtore to Health that Region which was grievouſly afflicted with the Scourges of Divine Severity; that he ſhould reſtore plenty to the barren Earth, beſtow his Benediction on the Inhabitants.</hi> And laſtly, <hi>Returning to</hi> Xaintes, <hi>that there he ſhould be diveſted of corruptible Fleſh, and his Soul aſcend to Eternal Felicity.</hi> As ſoon as he was come back, he was receiv'd with more then ordinary reſpect, but preſently after dy'd full of Days and Sanctity, and was bury'd by <hi>Leontius</hi> in <hi>Aquitain:</hi> Now though the Inhabitants of <hi>Aleth</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:96414:80"/>were depriv'd of the Sacred Relicks of their prime Prelate, whom they had treated ſo injuriouſly; yet the name of Bleſſed <hi>Maclovius</hi> remains, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be blotted out, adorning and defending that City to this day with his Coeleſtial Benefits and Glorious Perfection. Howbeit the Epiſcopal See does not now remain at <hi>Aleth,</hi> but is remov'd to an Iſland two Miles diſtant from thence, Antiently call'd <hi>Aaron,</hi> where a City new built is in memory of their Holy Prelate and Patron, call'd St. <hi>Malo,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbs Maclovienſis.</hi> It is ſaid that St. <hi>Mahutus</hi> with his ſeven Diſciples in Devotion viſited <hi>Rome,</hi> where he redeem'd many Infidel Captives; and having inſtructed them in the true Faith, Baptiz'd them.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Brendan</hi> his Spiritual Father and Inſtructor, though no <hi>Britain</hi> by Birth, is not to be deny'd ſome place in this Hiſtory: He came out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to viſit the Holy man St. <hi>Gildas Albanius</hi> in <hi>Britain:</hi> He was alſo Superiour in the Monaſtery of <hi>Lancarvan,</hi> where he Baptiz'd St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clovius,</hi> and returning into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he was made an Abbot, there dy'd Happily in the year of Grace 571. The death of this Bleſſed man, is ſaid to be reveal'd to St. <hi>Columba,</hi> who declar'd, <hi>That he ſaw the Heavens on a ſuddain open'd, and a Choire of Angels deſcending to meet St.</hi> Brendan<hi>'s Soul, by whoſe incomparable Splendour, the whole World was that night Enlightn'd:</hi> St. <hi>Brendan</hi> thus call'd to Heaven, enjoy'd on Earth alſo an Eternal Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Name and Sanctity: For in the Iſle of <hi>Orkney,</hi> a Town and Church were built and call'd from his Name, the reaſon was, becauſe his Sacred Body was thither tranſlated.</p>
            <p>In this Age flouriſh'd a Holy <hi>Britiſh</hi> Abbot call'd St. <hi>Doc,</hi> of whom is written, <hi>That when St.</hi> Canic, <hi>of whom the Province of</hi> Kilkenny <hi>took its Name, was grown to an Age of capable knowledge, being deſirous of inſtruction, he paſs'd over into</hi> Britain <hi>to a Religious man call'd</hi> Doc, <hi>and under him ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died diligently, and was taught both Learning and Piety:</hi> This St. <hi>Doc</hi> was one of the three Holy <hi>Britains</hi> from whom the <hi>Iriſh</hi> learn'd the form and Rites of Celebrating <hi>Maſs:</hi> The other two were St. <hi>David</hi> and St. <hi>Gildas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the death of King <hi>Arthur, Conſtantine</hi> according to his deſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſucceeded him in the Government of <hi>Britain:</hi> He was the Son of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and Kinſman to the King: His ſufficiency to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that employment for the Benefit of his Country, was enough ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by the choice of his glorious Predeceſſor: But Almighty God hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fix'd a period to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Monarchy, permitted many Factions to ariſe, and many Pretendants to the Principality, the oppoſing of whom hindred <hi>Conſtantine</hi> from advancing the common profit and ſafety of the Kingdom: Moreover, Ambition and Revenge had ſuch a Power over him, that they invited him to commit Crimes, which haſt'ned the ruine of his Country. Hence it is that <hi>Gildas</hi> calls him the Tyrant of <hi>Danmonia,</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in regard of his Cruelty, and Tyrant of that Province, becauſe at that time ſeveral others had invaded each one their ſeveral Principalities, and for the maintaining of their unjuſt Uſurpations, fill'd the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with all manner of Impieties; which gave occaſion to the ſame <hi>Gildas</hi> to publiſh a Paſſionate Invective againſt the Vices of the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, which had univerſally depriv'd the Inhabitants of all ſtates and conditions, an exceeding few excepted; who forſeeing the unavoidable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Nation, withdrew themſelves from publick Affairs, and in ſolitude deplor'd the ſins of others, by great Pennances and Auſterities, procuring Indulgence to their own Souls. <hi>In former times</hi> (ſaith <hi>Gildas)
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96414:81"/>our Kings publick Officers, private Perſons, Biſhops and other Eccleſiaſticks, every one kept their Order, and perform'd the Duties belonging to them; But when they were dead, there ſucceeded a Generation, utterly ignorant of the former Virtues, among whom all the Rules of Truth and Juſtice were ſo ſhaken and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that no footſteps, nor ſo much as the leaſt Monument of thoſe Virtues appear'd in any of the ſaid Orders. Conſtantine</hi> at his firſt Aſcenſion into his Throne, bound himſelf by a Solemn Oath, to govern Juſtly, and to uſe his utmoſt endeavours to defend his Subjects from Injuries and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the Commonwealth from the violence of its Enemies. And yet the year following, we find him charg'd with Perjury, and the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Faith, by his Barbarous Cruelty and Sacrilegious Prophanation of Gods Houſe; For the two Sons of <hi>Mordred</hi> riſing up in Arms againſt him, to revenge their Fathers death, joyn'd in Confederacy with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and fought many Battles with him; but at laſt being compell'd to fly, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> purſu'd them, and one of them he ſlew before the Altar of St. <hi>Amphibalus</hi> his Church in <hi>Wincheſter;</hi> the other who had hid himſelf in a Convent of Monks, he Condemned to a Cruel death in <hi>London:</hi> For this Sacrilegious Inhumanity, <hi>Gildas</hi> in his too free ſtile, calls <hi>Conſtantine, The Tyrannical Whelp of the Lioneſs of</hi> Danmonia; <hi>an infringer of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sacrament of an Oath, by which he bound himſelf before God and all his Saints; to abſtain from all Injuſtice and Treachery to his Subjects; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, in the very boſom both of their Carnal Mother, and Spiritual Mother the Church, near the moſt Holy Altar, he had torn the Bowels of two Royal Youths, though cover'd with the Veſtments of a Holy Abbot, whilſt they ſtretch'd forth their Hands, not armed with Swords to reſiſt, but to implore help from God and his Altar; and yet he moſt Barbarouſly ſhed their Blood; which, with a Purple dye ſtain'd the ſeat of the Eccleſiaſtical Sacrifice, and the Sacred Palls which cover'd it.</hi> To this Invective, the ſame Author adjoyns moſt preſſing Exhortations to <hi>Conſtantine, That he would do ſuitable Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for theſe horrible Crimes; that if poſſible he might avoid the dark inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable Torrents of Eternal fire, in which otherwiſe he must for ever be roll'd and roaſted.</hi> By theſe Expreſſions, it ſhould ſeem, theſe two Sons of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> were not ſo much to be blam'd for their riſing, all Circumſtances conſider'd: Probable it is, that theſe, or ſuch like Exhortations wrought a good effect upon <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> for though ſome write that he was ſlain by <hi>Conan,</hi> who ſucceeded in the Kingdom, yet others tell another Story, <hi>viz. That after a ſhort reign, having been depriv'd of his Wife and Children, be grew weary of his Kingdom, and privily ſtealing from his Friends, went into</hi> Ireland, <hi>and there for the love of Chriſt, labour'd unknown like a poor Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in a Mill; but afterward by perſwaſion of a Monk, to whom he diſcover'd his condition, he was induc'd to ſhave his Head, and Conſecrate himſelf to a Religious Life in a Monaſtery, where he is ſaid to live with ſuch Piety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, that he became a pattern of all Virtues to the reſt of the Monks. That at laſt by the Prelate of that place he was ſent in Miſſion to the</hi> Scots, <hi>to inſtruct that Nation in the Doctrine of Christ, where he ſuffer'd Martyrdom by the hands of ſome Impious perſons: Some Ages after he became Venerated as a Saint, and by Authority of ſucceeding Biſhops, Temples were Dedicated to his Honour, which yet remain in that Nation.</hi> To confirm this, we read in the Life of St. <hi>David, That when St.</hi> David<hi>'s Holineſs was ſpread abroad, ſeveral Princes forſaking their Kingdoms, retir'd to his Monaſtery: And that</hi> Conſtantine <hi>King of the</hi> Corniſh-men, <hi>or</hi> Danmonii, <hi>forſaking his Throne, became a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96414:81"/>Monk there, and after ſome time ſpent in the Service of God, at laſt went into a far diſtant Country, where he built a Monaſtery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it will be time to relate the great Affliction and Perſecution which befell the famous and Holy Biſhop St. <hi>Kentigern</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine.</hi> Certain Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> Kinſmen to King <hi>Mark,</hi> roſe againſt the Saint, conſpiring his death; whereupon being admoniſh'd by Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, he departed, directing his Journey to <hi>Menevia,</hi> where the Holy Biſhop <hi>David</hi> flouriſh'd with all Virtues; near <hi>Gaerleon</hi> he Converted many to the Faith, and built a Church: Being come to St. <hi>David,</hi> he abode with him ſome time, and receiv'd from the Prince of that Region <hi>Cathwallam,</hi> a place commodious for a Monaſtery; which having Erected at <hi>Egla (Elwy)</hi> he fix'd there an Epiſcopal See: Near that place there was a Nobleman, which often threatn'd, and endeavour'd to expel him from thence, whom God therefore ſmote with Blindneſs; but upon the Holy Biſhops Prayers, his Sight was reſtor'd, for which he became ever after Helper and Protector to the Biſhop: There were Aſſembled in that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, no fewer then 945 Brethren, who all liv'd under Monaſtical Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, ſerving God with great Abſtinence, of which number 300. who were Illiterate, he appointed to Tilling the Ground, and Guard of the Cattle out of the Monaſtery; other 300. he aſſign'd for preparing Nouriſhment, and performing other neceſſary Works within the Monaſtery; and 365. who were Learn'd, he deputed to the Celebrating Divine Offices daily: Not any of which, without great neceſſity, would he permit to go out of the Monaſtery, but ordain'd them to attend there continually, as in Gods Sanctuary: And this part of the Convent he divided ſo into Troops and Companies, that when one had finiſh'd the Service of God in the Church, another preſently enter'd, and began it again; which being ended, a third without any delay enter'd: By this means Prayers were offer'd in that Church without intermiſſion, and the Praiſes of God were always in their Mouths. Among theſe there was one nam'd <hi>Aſaph,</hi> more eſpecially Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious for his Deſcent and Form, who from his Childhood ſhone brightly, both by Virtues and Miracles, and daily endeavour'd to imitate his Maſter in all Sanctity and Abſtinence: To him this man of God bore ever after a particular Affection, and committed the care of the Monaſtery to his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and at laſt appointed him his Succeſſor in the Biſhoprick: As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fore-mention'd Noble-man who oppos'd this Holy Biſhop, it is written to this effect, <hi>That St.</hi> Kentigern <hi>at firſt built a Church of Wood and Lime, but after he renew'd it of Stone, although he was therein much hindred and moleſted by a Prince nam'd</hi> Malgo <hi>or</hi> Maglocun, <hi>whoſe dwelling was ſix Miles thence at</hi> Deganwy; <hi>but after being aſſwag'd, he permitted him to place there an Epiſcopal See, on which he beſtow'd both ample Poſſeſſions and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, as he did alſo upon the Monaſtery.</hi> The See is by ſome call'd <hi>Elguy</hi> or <hi>Llanelwy,</hi> ſo nam'd from the River <hi>Elwy,</hi> over which it is ſeated; St. <hi>Kentigern</hi> being the firſt Biſhop thereof: But in ſucceeding times it was call'd St. <hi>Aſaph,</hi> from the next ſucceeding Biſhop. Of this Prince <hi>Malgo</hi> more hereafter.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Kentigern</hi>'s Life was prolong'd, till after St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monks coming into <hi>Britain;</hi> yet becauſe his future Actions, do not much relate to the general Affairs of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches, we may well in this place ſum up the remainder of his Life: He remain'd in <hi>Cambria</hi> ſeventeen years, exerciſing moſt perfectly the Functions both of an Abbot, and after of a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96414:82"/>Biſhop at <hi>Elwy,</hi> till in the end he was re-call'd to his firſt Biſhoprick at <hi>Glaſco</hi> in this admirable manner: <hi>After that all his Enemies in</hi> Cambria <hi>had been conſum'd by divers Calamities and Diſeaſes, the Inhahitants of that Region from whence he had been ſo long Exild, through his Abſence, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the way of the Lord, which he had taught them, and were return'd to their Idolatry, like Dogs to their Vomit; which Apoſtacy of theirs it pleas'd God to puntſh by a grievous Famine, the Earth, the Sea, and all the Elements refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their accuſtom'd aid and comfort to them: But at length our Lord was pleas'd to raiſe up a good King in that Region nam'd</hi> Rederech, <hi>who had been Baptiz'd by ſome of the Diſciples of St.</hi> Patrick, <hi>and who was very deſirous to reſtore the Faith of Chriſt in his Kingdom; for which purpoſe he directed Meſſengers with Letters to St.</hi> Kentigern, <hi>wherein he acquainted the Saint, That the men who ſought his Life were dead, and beſought him, that he would no longer be abſent from his flock, for which he was oblig'd to Sacrifice his Life; St.</hi> Kentigern <hi>having receiv'd the Meſsage, prepar'd for his return, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving appointed St.</hi> Aſaph <hi>his Succeſſor in the Biſhoprick of</hi> Elwy, <hi>he attended with</hi> 600 <hi>of his Brethren, took his Journey to the Region of the</hi> Cambrians, <hi>and was met by the Devout King, and great numbers of his People, giving Thanks to God for his Preſence, upon whom the Holy man pronounced a ſolemn Benediction: After this he cry'd with a loud voice.</hi> In the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I command all thoſe who envy the Salvation of men, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Preaching of Gods word, to depart preſently from hence, that they may be no hinderance to thoſe who ſhall believe: <hi>Having ſaid thus, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in the ſight of all, an innumerable multitude of wicked Spirits hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to behold, both for their Stature and Shapes, fled away from the Company, which caus'd a wonderful Fear and trembling in them: But the Holy man, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd and comforted them, letting them ſee viſibly who they were in whom they had believ'd, and by whom they had been induced to Adore dumb Idols, or the Elements which were Creatures appointed by God for their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Service: And for</hi> Woden, <hi>whom by the Seduction of the</hi> Saxons <hi>they eſteem'd their principal God: And to whoſe Honour they Conſecrated the fourth day of the Week, he ſhew'd that he was no better than a Mortal man, who had been King of the</hi> Saxons, <hi>and Anceſtor to ſeveral Nations; that his Body was then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd into Duſt, and his Soul tormented in Hell fire for ever.</hi> When he had ſaid this, with other Speeches in explanation of the Chriſtian Faith: <hi>The ground on which he ſate in a plain Field call'd</hi> Holdelin, <hi>ſwell'd up under him in the ſight of them all, ſo as it grew to a reaſonable high Hill, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi> (as is ſaid) <hi>to this day:</hi> All the People ſeeing theſe wonders, after they were inſtructed in the Faith, receiv'd Baptiſm, and thus by his Doctrine he freed the Nation of the <hi>Picts</hi> from Idolatry and Hereſie: He Converted likewiſe the Country of <hi>Albania,</hi> therein building many Churches, and Founding many Monaſteries: Whilſt St. <hi>Kentigern</hi> liv'd among the <hi>Picts,</hi> St. <hi>Columba,</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> call'd <hi>Columkill,</hi> hearing in his Monaſtery in the Iſle of <hi>Hy,</hi> the Fame of this Holy Biſhop, came with a great Troop of his Diſciples to viſit him, and was met by him with the like multitude; which they divided on each ſide into three Companies: The Firſt of Young men; The Second ſuch as were of Perfect Age; And the Third Venerable Old men: All which on the way towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sang Spiritual Songs; and when St. <hi>Columba</hi> came in ſight of the Biſhop, turning himſelf to his Diſciples, he ſaid, <hi>I ſee a Pillar of Fire, as it were a Golden Crown, in the third Choire deſcending upon the Biſhop, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96414:82"/>caſting a Caeleſtial Splendor about him:</hi> Then the two Holy men approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one another with great fervour of Affection, gave, and receiv'd mutual Kiſſes and Embraces: The King of the <hi>Picts</hi> is ſaid to be preſent at the meeting; and afterwards St. <hi>Columba</hi> going to a Monaſtery joyning to the Caſtle of <hi>Caledonia</hi> built by <hi>Convallus,</hi> there inſtructed the <hi>Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> in the Faith; the <hi>Horeſti</hi> alſo, and other Neighbouring Nations: In the ſame place was afterwards Erected a Church Dedicated to St. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumba,</hi> and Plentifully endow'd by the following Kings of the <hi>Scots;</hi> which Church being an Epiſcopal See, was vulgarly call'd <hi>Dunkeld:</hi> Yet it may be likely that the Author of this Relation concerning the Church of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keld</hi> may be miſtaken, confounding the Actions of two Saints, both Nam'd <hi>Columba;</hi> for it is certain that St. <hi>Columba,</hi> who was firſt Biſhop of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keld,</hi> flouriſh'd almoſt a 100 years after this time, and to him it was that St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> being then a Child was recommended; which miſtake is Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, becauſe, as Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> obſerves, <hi>There were in</hi> Ireland <hi>almoſt</hi> 20 <hi>ſeveral men of the Name</hi> Columba.</p>
            <p>In the year of Grace 593. St. <hi>Kentigern</hi> out of <hi>Britain,</hi> and a Biſhop call'd <hi>Alban</hi> out of <hi>Ireland</hi> went to <hi>Rome</hi> to viſit Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great; ſaith Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher:</hi> And as it may be probably gueſs'd at, from a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the ſtate of the Church in thoſe times, upon this ſpecial occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: The famous Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> having condemn'd <hi>Eutyches</hi> and his Doctrine, which confounded the two Natures in Chriſt, was rejected by a Faction of the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> call'd <hi>Acephali,</hi> becauſe it ſeem'd to them to favour the contrary <hi>Hereſie</hi> of the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> formerly condemn'd, who acknowledg'd not only two Natures, but two perſons in our Lord. The grounds on which the <hi>Acephali</hi> charg'd the Council, was</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe it ſeem'd to approve an Epiſtle of</hi> Ibas <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Edeſſa.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> Secondly, <hi>The Writings of</hi> Theodorus <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Mopſueſtia <hi>full of Blaſphemous paſſages ſavouring of</hi> Neſtorianiſm.</p>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96414:83"/>Biſhops at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and when the Suffrages of the Biſhops were brought to him, he wrote a Decree, which he ſent to <hi>Menas,</hi> in which alſo he confirm'd the <hi>tria Capitula;</hi> Howbeit, this Condeſcention of <hi>Vigilius</hi> to avoid a rent in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches, was ill taken in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> inſomuch, as the Biſhops of <hi>Africa, Illyricum</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> withdrew themſelves from his Communion, and <hi>Facundus,</hi> who defended their Cauſe, call'd him a Prevaricator: Upon which <hi>Vigilius</hi> endeavour'd to perſwade the Emperor in the preſence of <hi>Menas</hi> and other <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Biſhops, <hi>That whatever had paſs'd on either ſide, ſhould be reſcinded, and that a Synod ſhould be aſſembled, to which particularly the</hi> African <hi>and</hi> Illyrian <hi>Biſhops, who had been ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd ſhould be call'd.</hi> But they being unwilling to obey, <hi>Vigilius</hi> was dealt withal, <hi>That in Caſe the</hi> Weſtern <hi>Biſhops would not comply; he joyning with the</hi> Greeks <hi>ſhould condemn the three Biſhops:</hi> Which he utterly refuſing, the Emperor's Decree was notwithſtanding publiſh'd: And when <hi>Vigilius,</hi> together with <hi>Dacius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> threatn'd the <hi>Grecian</hi> Biſhops with Excommunication, in caſe they conſented to the Decree; The Emperor was ſo incenſed, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was forc'd to ſly for refuge into St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church; from which Sanctuary, when the Emperor's Officer endeavour'd to draw him, he was repell'd by a Tumult of the People: But many inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries being ſtill offer'd to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> he fled by night to <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> into the Church of St. <hi>Euphremia.</hi> But the conſtancy of <hi>Vigilius</hi> procur'd this effect, That laying aſide the Imperial Edicts, the diſcuſſion of the whole Cauſe ſhould be reſerv'd to a Synod, which the <hi>Pope</hi> deſired to have Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in <hi>Italy;</hi> but the <hi>Graecians</hi> refuſing, it was agreed that an equal number of <hi>Weſtern</hi> Biſhops ſhould be ſummon'd to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> which agreement notwithſtanding, the Emperour ſummon'd all the reſt of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Patriarchs: Thus a Council of <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Biſhops only met, at which <hi>Vigilius</hi> refus'd to be preſent, not eſteeming it Canonical, in regard the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Biſhops were abſent, who were moſt concern'd in the affair. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, after 20 days reſpite obtain'd, <hi>Vigilius</hi> ſent a writing to the Emperor, which he call'd a <hi>Conſtitutum,</hi> wherein he at large gave his judgment of the <hi>Tria Capitula,</hi> telling him, <hi>That as to the Blaſphemies of</hi> Theodorus, <hi>he did abhor them; but in imitation of the Council of</hi> Epheſus, <hi>would ſpare his Name. Again, that it would be ſuperfluous to caſt any infamy on the Writings of</hi> Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret <hi>againſt St.</hi> Cyril; <hi>ſince St.</hi> Cyril <hi>himſelf, and the Councel of</hi> Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>had requir'd no other ſatisfaction from him, but only to pronounce</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema, <hi>againſt</hi> Neſtorius, <hi>which he did: And as for the Epiſtle of</hi> Ibas, <hi>no diſcuſſion ſhould be made of it, after the Council of</hi> Chalcedon. This <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutum</hi> the Emperor, contrary to his Promiſe, reſerv'd to himſelf; but withall acquainted the Synod, with <hi>Vigilius</hi> his mind concerning the <hi>Tria Capitula,</hi> which he had often-times both by words and writing expreſs'd; the Synod proceeded to a condemnation of them, complaining withal, <hi>That the</hi> Pope <hi>would not afford his preſence to them:</hi> After this definition of the Biſhops in the Council, the <hi>Pope</hi> being in extream Anguiſh, becauſe he ſaw how the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Biſhops would be offended, and that the Scandal would be the greater, becauſe the Emperor had not ſent his <hi>Conſtitutum</hi> to the Council, utterly refus'd his Conſent or Approbation of their Definition; for which refuſal, he was by the Emperour ſent into Baniſhment with other Biſhops. His Baniſhment continu'd not long, for ſix months after the Synods Definition, <hi>Vigilius</hi> ſent a Decretal Epiſtle to <hi>Entychius</hi> Succeſſor to <hi>Menas,</hi> in which he condemn'd the <hi>Tria Capitula,</hi> and profeſs'd Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96414:83"/>with all thoſe who embracing the four Councils of the Church had condemn'd the ſame, (meaning thereby the laſt Council, which he would not Name:) This Decree of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> was by the <hi>Graecians</hi> referr'd among the Acts of the Council, by virtue whereof it became a Lawful Oecumenical Council: This end being given to this unneceſſary Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy; all the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches, excepting only the Biſhops of <hi>Iſtria, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> and <hi>Liguria,</hi> conſented to it: But theſe Churches being under the Dominion of the <hi>Longobardi,</hi> broke into an open <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which continu'd till the time of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great.</p>
            <p>Beſides them, we find no other Church unſatisfy'd, except <hi>Ireland</hi> only; To the Biſhop whereof St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> a year before St. <hi>Kentigern</hi>'s Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> wrote an Epiſtle in Anſwer to one of theirs, who had charg'd the <hi>Roman</hi> See, with injuring the Councel of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> by condemning the <hi>Tria Capitula:</hi> But St. <hi>Gregory</hi> inform'd them, <hi>That this Controverſy did not at all touch the Faith of the Church, but the Perſons only of two or three Biſhops: That the Authority of the Council of</hi> Chalcedon <hi>was entire, both with thoſe who oppugned, and thoſe who defended the</hi> Tria Capitula, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none could have juſt cauſe to make a rent in the Church, upon ſo trifling a quarrel.</hi> This anſwer of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s ſeems to give ſatisfaction to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> for ſeveral Epiſtles afterwards paſt from him to them, as unanimous Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, inſtructing them touching the Rites in Baptiſm, and whether it were to be adminiſtred to thoſe who return'd from the <hi>Neſtorian He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi> &amp;c. This Controverſy was hotly agitated when St. <hi>Kentigern</hi> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and perhaps it might be a conſiderable motive of his Journey; eſpecially in regard an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Biſhop call'd <hi>Albanus,</hi> went thither at the ſame time. And although the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches are no where taxed for partaking with thoſe who were divided from the <hi>Roman</hi> See; yet it might well become the Zeal of ſo Holy a Biſhop as St. <hi>Kentigern</hi> to inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf truly of the ſtate of ſuch a Controverſy, as hath been therefore the more at large ſet down.</p>
            <p>The man of God St. <hi>Kentigern,</hi> after his return from <hi>Rome,</hi> being worn away with Age, for he was 85 years old, had his Nerves ſo diſſolv'd, that he was forc'd to ſuſtain his Jaws by tying a linnen Ribbon about his Head which came under his Chin, that with the leſs trouble he might pronounce his Words: This diſſolution of his Nerves was promis'd him a little before his Death, to the end, that ſince his whole Life had been a continual Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by the good pleaſure of our Lord, his Death might be milder and eaſier, then that of other men ordinarily. At length calling together his Diſciples, he earneſtly exhorted them, <hi>To continue their obſervance of the Duties of their Holy Religion, their mutual Charity, Peace, Hoſpitality, their diligence in Reading and Prayer.</hi> He bequeath'd to them earneſt and efficacious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, firmly to obey the Decrees of the Holy Fathers, and conſtitutions of the Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Church: After which exhortation, he departed to our Lord. The Fame of his Sanctity ſoon after his Death was every where ſpread by a World of Miracles, as many Authors relate.</p>

               <hi>Aurelius Conanus</hi> dying in the fourth year of his reign, <hi>Vortipor</hi> Prince of the <hi>Dimetae</hi> ſucceeded him: By <hi>Gildas</hi> he is Styl'd, <hi>A Tyrant, who in his Old Age aſcended the Throne by Civil Diſcords, being a wicked Son of a good Prince, defil'd by many Parricides and Adulteries; who thinking to rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his Lawful Wife, wallow'd in Luſt with her Impudent Daughter, and thereupon he exhorts him by a timely Repentance to avert Gods Judgements.</hi> His reign likewiſe laſting only four years, his Throne was Invaded by <hi>Malgo Conanus,</hi> or <hi>Maglocunus,</hi> a Prince no leſs Vicious than his Predeceſſor, for he is ſaid to have Murder'd his Uncle, Prince of <hi>Venedocia,</hi> call'd <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallain,</hi> with the greateſt part of his Nobility. This is the ſame <hi>Maglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunus,</hi> who afforded to St. <hi>Kentigern</hi> a place for a Church and Monaſtery, and after being tormented with a remorſe for his Parricides, he relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd the World and retir'd into a Monaſtery, where he undertook a Monaſtical Profeſſion: But the Sparks of Ambition thus cover'd, broke forth again into a flame; ſo that quitting his Solitude, he return'd to all his former Crimes, and became an Inſular Dragon, depreſſing other Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and by ſtrengthning himſelf with their Power, became the greateſt Tyrant.</p>
            <pb n="163" facs="tcp:96414:84"/>
            <p>In the ſecond year of his reign, a great Battle was Fought between the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Kenric</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons,</hi> near <hi>Sorbiodunum,</hi> or <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury;</hi> in which Combat, after much Blood-ſhed, the <hi>Britains</hi> were at laſt forc'd to fly: Four years after the <hi>Britains</hi> Thirſting to avenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this Defeat, gather'd together all their beſt Forces, againſt whom <hi>Cenric</hi> with his Son <hi>Ceaulin</hi> March'd: The Armies met in the Province of the <hi>Dobuni</hi> or <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> at <hi>Banbury:</hi> The <hi>Britains</hi> divided their Armies into nine Bodies, three of which they placed in the Front, three in the midſt, and three in the Reer: The <hi>Saxons,</hi> though inferior in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, yet exceeded them in Stature and Length, and Fought all in one Body: The Combat was Bloody, continuing till night, doubtful it was, which had the better: After which, many Battles paſt between them, wherein for the moſt part, the Victory fell to the <hi>Weſt-Saxons;</hi> while the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> contended in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> the <hi>Picts</hi> beyond the <hi>Frith</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> made <hi>Bridius</hi> their King, who was Nephew to <hi>Loth</hi> their former King.</p>
            <p>In the ninth year of <hi>Bridius</hi> St. <hi>Columba</hi> came out of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> being the year of Grace 565. The year following dy'd the Tyrant <hi>Maglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunus,</hi> after whom <hi>Careticus</hi> took upon him to ſuſtain the State of <hi>Britain,</hi> every day more and more falling to ruine; but with ill ſucceſs; for beſides, that God had fix'd a Period to that State, this Prince prov'd no better than his Predeceſſors, but like them ſtain'd with all Vices. <hi>Gildas</hi> ſeems to give a ſhameful Character to ſeveral Princes, by his manner of writing, moſt of them ſeem to have reign'd in ſeveral Provinces at the ſame time: For beſides this <hi>Bridius,</hi> he directs the point of his ſharp Style againſt one nam'd <hi>Lunegaſla,</hi> by interpretation the <hi>Yellow Lyon,</hi> whom he accuſes of all ſorts of Crimes, <hi>Impiety againſt God, and Savage Cruelty to his Subjects, repudiating his Lawful Wife, and violating his Sister, who after Widdow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, had vow'd Chaſtity to God; and by many injuries afflicting Holy men and Prieſts, who ceas'd not to offer up their Sighs and Prayers for him: Gildas</hi> therefore exhorts him, <hi>To change his Life, that he might reap the benefit of their Prayers, who had Power to bind in Heaven, what they had bound in this World, and to looſe ſuch as were Penitent.</hi> Now by the Impieties of theſe Princes, the Reader may obſerve the Juſtice of Gods ſeverity againſt ſo wicked a Nation, from which he took the Spiritual Kingdom of Chriſt, and beſtow'd it upon a People which brought forth better fruits: Yet out of this Dung-hill of Vices ſome Pearls were to be gather'd; for here we find the Wiſe <hi>Gildas</hi> commending a perpetual vow of Chaſtity, made not only by Virgins, but by Widdows alſo; the infringing of which Vow he bitterly inveighs againſt, and acknowledgeth in Gods Prieſts a Power of retaining and abſolving Sinners not by way of Declaration only, but of Authority and Juriſdiction alſo.</p>
            <p>In the year 559. dy'd <hi>Ida</hi> King of the <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> to whom ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Son <hi>Alla,</hi> whoſe Empire extended both over the <hi>Deiri</hi> and <hi>Bernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> yet were there in ſome of thoſe Provinces <hi>Britiſh</hi> Princes, who call'd themſelves Kings, though in Dependance on him: Such as <hi>Morken</hi> King of the <hi>Cumbrians,</hi> which Dependant Princes had upon Treaty a promiſſive Authority in their peculiar Provinces.</p>
            <p>This Age affords an example of the Zeal and Authority of a Holy Biſhop exercis'd Synodically, and of a Princes Devout ſubmiſſion to this Authority: The Biſhops name was St. <hi>Oudoceus,</hi> Son of <hi>Anaumeda,</hi> Siſter

Whereupon the Inhabitants repair'd to their former Prince <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric,</hi> whom they even compell'd to quit his Deſart; and to be their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in the War: He full of Divine Courage encounter'd the Infidel Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whom he put to flight at <hi>Tintern</hi> near the River <hi>Vaga:</hi> But having receiv'd a Mortal Wound in the Combat, he return'd homeward, and gave Charge to his Son <hi>Mouric, That in what place ſoever he ſhould end his Life, he ſhould there build a Church to God, and a Sepulchre for himſelf:</hi> And ſo not having paſs'd five Miles, at a place where <hi>Vaga</hi> and <hi>Severn</hi> met, he gave up his Spirit.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:96414:85"/>his Wife a Widdow:</hi> The King remaining with his whole Region the ſpace of two years, and more, thus Excommunicated: After being ſenſible of the Perdition of his own Soul, and the damnation of his whole Kingdom, he could no longer ſuſtain ſo dreadful an Excommunication, but humbly beg'd Pardon at <hi>Landaff</hi> of Biſhop <hi>Oudoceus;</hi> who therefore in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of three Abbots impos'd on him the yoak of Pennance, proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the quality and hainouſneſs of his Crimes; the King all the while humbly inclining his Head, and ſhedding Tears abundantly; His Pennance was to ſatisfie God, <hi>By Faſting, Prayers and Alms;</hi> King <hi>Mauric</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the yoak of Pennance, and for the Redemption of his own Soul, and the Soul of <hi>Cynetu,</hi> he gave to the Church of <hi>Landaff</hi> and the Biſhops thereof, four Villages, with their entire liberty, free from all ſervice for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; with Common through his Country for the Inhabitants of thoſe Villages, in all Fields, Woods, Paſtures and Waters: Theſe four Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages contain 24 <hi>Modii</hi> of Land: The firſt is call'd <hi>Kirgracnauc,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Nantavo;</hi> the third a Village beyond <hi>Kadava,</hi> where <hi>Cynetu</hi> was ſlain; the fourth a Village beyond <hi>Nadava,</hi> call'd <hi>Gudberdh.</hi> This was the form of the firſt Synod of <hi>Landaff,</hi> out of which we may collect much of the Religion and Diſcipline of that Age: The ſame Biſhop <hi>Oudoceus,</hi> for very like cauſes Aſſembled two Synods more extant in Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> the occaſions whereof, and proceedings wherein, here briefly follow: <hi>King</hi> Morcant <hi>and his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle</hi> Frioc, <hi>in the preſence of St.</hi> Oudoceus <hi>and the three fore-nam'd Abbots at the</hi> Poduim, <hi>or Church of St.</hi> Ildutus, <hi>took their Oaths at the Holy Altar, on which were placed the Relicks of Saints, That they would obſerve Peace and Amity together without any guile; adding, That if either of them, ſhould Kill or commit Treachery againſt the other, he ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem his Crime by Money or Lands, but ſhould be oblig'd to quit his Kingdom, and ſpend his whole Life in Forreign Pilgrimages: A good while after which Covenant made,</hi> Morcant <hi>by the inſtigation of the Devil ſlew his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, but ſoon after came to the Holy Biſhop</hi> Oudoceus, <hi>and humbly crav'd Pardon for his Homicide and Perjury: The Biſhop thereupon Aſſembled a Synod at the Monaſtery of the Vale of</hi> Carban, <hi>to which came all the Clergy, and King</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant <hi>alſo, with the principal perſons of</hi> Glamorganſhire: <hi>The Synod unwilling to be depriv'd of their Natural Lord, gave judgement, that the King ſhould redeem his Pilgrimage with Alms, Prayers and Faſting; which Pennance the King laying his Hands on the four Goſpels and Relicks of Saints undertook to perform; promiſing withall, that ever after he would in all things mercifully execute Juſtice. The Pennance finiſh'd, and the King reſtor'd to Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; he preſently proclaim'd the Churches of</hi> Catoc, Ildut <hi>and</hi> Docunni <hi>free from all Regal Service.</hi> Thus was the ſecond Synod: The third was Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled many years after upon this occaſion, <hi>A certain</hi> Britiſh <hi>Prince nam'd Guidnerth, in a Contention for the Principality ſlew his Brother</hi> Mercheen; <hi>for which he was Excommunicated by St.</hi> Oudoceus <hi>in a full Synod; in teſtimony of which Excommunication the Croſſes were taken down, and the Cimbals were turn'd; thus he remain'd excluded from Chriſtian Communion for the ſpace of three years; at the end of which, demanding Pardon, he was ſent into the leſſer</hi> Britain <hi>to St.</hi> Sampſon <hi>Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Dole, <hi>from him to receive judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſuitable Pennance: This was done, partly becauſe of the great Amity between theſe Biſhops, but chiefly becauſe the ſame Language being ſpoken in both Countries, he would the more freely diſcover his fault, and require In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence for the ſame: This Voyage was undertaken by</hi> Guidnerth, <hi>who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96414:86"/>obtain'd Abſolution, he return'd with Letters Seal'd by St.</hi> Sampſon <hi>before the year was ended; but becauſe he had not according to his Injunction remain'd a whole year in Exile, the Biſhop would not take off his Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; preſently after St.</hi> Oudoceus <hi>dy'd, to whom</hi> Berthguin <hi>ſucceeded in the Biſhoprick of</hi> Landaff: <hi>To him King</hi> Morcant <hi>and</hi> Guidnerth <hi>made an carneſt requeſt, to take off the ſaid Excommunication, and to raiſe again from the Earth the Croſſes and Cimbals with the Holy Relicks: Whereupon, after a promiſe made by</hi> Guidnerth, <hi>to make ſatisfaction for his Crime by Faſting, Prayers and Alms, he was at laſt with great Devotion and many Tears ſhed, Abſolv'd by the Biſhop: After which</hi> Guidnerth, <hi>to teſtifie his Gratitude, gave to the Church of</hi> Landaff <hi>theſe Lands</hi> Lanu, Catigual <hi>and</hi> Tye, <hi>with all the Woods and Sea-coaſts,</hi> &amp;c. Biſhop <hi>Godwin</hi> affirms this third Synod to be Celebrated by another Biſhop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> and that <hi>Guidnerth</hi> the <hi>Fratricide</hi> gave <hi>Lancadwallader,</hi> now call'd <hi>Biſhton</hi> or <hi>Biſhopston</hi> to the Church of <hi>Landaff; Which Mannor,</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>is the only Mannor that is left to that See.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of the Life of St. <hi>Oudoceus</hi> relates, <hi>That he quitted his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Cure, and built a Monaſtery near the River</hi> Weye; <hi>and there Aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a great multitude of Brethren, ſpent the remainder of his Life, which laſted many years, in wonderful Abſtinence and Sanctity;</hi> So as it may ſeem this third Synod was not held in his days. We often have had occaſion to draw Teſtimonies from our famous Hiſtorian <hi>Gildas,</hi> Sir-named <hi>Bado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> and <hi>Sapiens,</hi> call'd alſo the Younger <hi>Gildas,</hi> to diſtinguiſh him from <hi>Gildas Albanius</hi> before-mention'd.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe we are come beyond the times of thoſe Princes, who have been painted out by him in their foul colours, it will be neceſſary to ſay what may be found of this our Younger <hi>Gildas:</hi> By his own Teſtimony, he was born in the ſame year, when the great Battle was Fought at the Mountain call'd <hi>Badonicus</hi> between the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> in the time of <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius;</hi> to which Mountains the <hi>Saxons</hi> retiring, were Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by the <hi>Britains,</hi> and after in a Battle diſcomfited; this happen'd in the year of Grace 493. forty years after the firſt entrance of the <hi>Saxons</hi> into <hi>Britain.</hi> This <hi>Gildas</hi> is affirm'd by the Author of his Life, <hi>To be the Diſciple of</hi> Iltutus, <hi>and leaving him to have gone into</hi> Ireland, <hi>He remain'd four years under the Diſcipline and Inſtruction of St.</hi> Iltutus; <hi>and having paſs'd through the Schools of many Learned Teachers in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and like a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Bee collected the Juice of divers Flowers, he laid it up carefully in the Hive of our Mother the Church, to the end he might in opportune ſeaſon, pour forth the Mellifluous Doctrine of the Goſpel to his own Country-men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by draw them out of Miſery to Eternal Joyes, and like a good Servant, reſtore unto his Lord the Talent entruſted with him. In this Iſland</hi> (ſaith Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>) <hi>there flouriſh'd in this Age the Schools of</hi> Armagh, <hi>wherein the Elder</hi> Gildas <hi>preſided, when he Piouſly labour'd in Cultivating the minds of the</hi> Iriſh; <hi>in which imployment probably this our Younger</hi> Gildas <hi>ſucceeded him; and here not only collected ſweet Juice, but got a ſharp ſting alſo; which he after darted forth againſt the Vices of his own Country: However in</hi> Ireland <hi>he reſtor'd Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline to the Eccleſiaſtical Order; he gather'd many Congregations of Monks, and mercifully deliver'd many Captives from the ſlavery of</hi> Pagans. After his return into <hi>Britain,</hi> it ſeems he found ſmall comfort or encouragement to pour forth the Honey which he had gather'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for he found in this Iſland, ſuch Calamities and Confuſions their reigning; ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96414:86"/>of wickedneſs and miſery, which ſhould exceed the other; that almoſt his whole imployment was to bewail the approaching deſtruction of his Country, and by publiſhing the Crimes, eſpecially of the Rulers, as well in Church as State, to juſtifie the Severity of God, being in truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath their demerits and provocations: Howbeit, he was by a double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation from <hi>Ireland,</hi> interrupted in his ſad Thoughts, and withdrawn from beholding ſuch mournful Spectacles, as every where in <hi>Britain</hi> offer'd themſelves to his Eyes. The firſt Meſſage about the year of our Lord 562. came from perſons of quality in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who ſent an Epiſtle to him; at the ſame time he received an Epiſtle alſo from St. <hi>Columba,</hi> whom he very much eſteem'd for his Sanctity. The ſecond Meſſage or invitation was directed to him from a King in <hi>Ireland</hi> named <hi>Ammeric,</hi> who requeſted this our <hi>Gildas, To come to him, promiſing that if he would undertake the Journey, and reſtore to good Order the Eccleſiaſticks of his Kingdom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in generally the Catholick Faith was decay'd, both himſelf and his Subjects would in all things be Obedient to him.</hi> St. <hi>Gildas</hi> hearing this, like a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Soldier throughly furniſh'd with Caeleſtial Arms, preſently went into <hi>Ireland,</hi> there to Preach the Goſpel of Chriſt: Being come thither, he was preſented to the King by ſome Noble perſons who were acquainted with him. The King gave him many gifts, and intreated him to ſtay ſome time, and reſtore Order to that Region, becauſe the Inhabitants had in a manner loſt the Chriſtian Faith: St. <hi>Gildas</hi> as thereupon Travelling through all the Provinces of <hi>Ireland,</hi> reſtor'd Churches, inſtructed the Clergy in the true Faith and Worſhip of the Holy Trinity, Cured thoſe who had been Poiſon'd with <hi>Hereſy,</hi> and expell'd all Teachers of Errour; So that by his zeal and diligence, Truth became again to flouriſh in the Country: After this the Holy man built many Monaſteries in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and inſtructed the Children of the Nobility in Learning and Piety; and to win the greater number to the ſervice of God, he himſelf became a <hi>Monk,</hi> and brought to the ſame Profeſſion very many, as well of the Nobility, as others; and alſo he compaſſionately freed many poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from the ſlavery of Infidels, and ſo became a ſecond Apoſtle to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> repairing the ruines of that Faith, which St. <hi>Patrick</hi> firſt Preach'd amongſt them. Now whereas it is ſaid, that the firſt Epiſtle to St. <hi>Gildas</hi> was brought by Faithful men, it is very probable, that the Holy Abbot <hi>Komgall</hi> was one of thoſe Faithful men. How long St. <hi>Gildas</hi> abode in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is uncertain, but it is certain, that the great work he there perform'd, could not be compleated in a ſhort time, and yet that he return'd into <hi>Britain,</hi> where he dy'd in a good Old Age, in the Monaſtery of <hi>Banchor,</hi> after he had liv'd ninety years. What Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> refers to the former St. <hi>Gildas</hi> may reaſonably be apply'd to this latter, namely, that St. <hi>Brendan</hi> the Son of <hi>Finloga</hi> in the year of our Lord 562. came into <hi>Britain</hi> to viſit the Holy old man <hi>Gildas,</hi> famous for his Wiſdom, this our latter <hi>Gildas</hi> at that time being above 70. years old.</p>
            <p>In the year of Grace 561. <hi>Irmeric</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> dy'd, after he had raign'd 30. years, leaving behind him a Son and Daughter; his Son and Succeſſors Name was <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> his Daughters <hi>Ricula:</hi> This is that famous <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> who, according to his Name was the Glory and Splendor of this Nation, who had the firſt Prerogative among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> of receiving and propagating the Chriſtian Faith. Some diſpoſition thereunto, began it ſeems in his Fathers time, who permitted at leaſt a private exerciſe of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:96414:87"/>Chriſtian Religion: Thirty years of <hi>Ethelbert's</hi> reign were never the leſs ſpent, before it was openly profeſs'd; during which time he was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exercis'd in War; wherein at firſt he ſuſtain'd great loſſes, which after he repair'd by many Victories, with which he much enlarg'd the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of his Dominions. In the third year of his reign St. <hi>Columba</hi> by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Civil Wars, was compell'd to quit <hi>Ireland,</hi> and come into <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> as <hi>Adelmannus</hi> who wrote his Life relates in this manner. <hi>Some time after the Civil War at</hi> Culedrebene, <hi>when</hi> Dermitius <hi>Son of</hi> Kerbail <hi>was Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and all buſineſs was determin'd before the Kings Tribunal; it happen'd ſo, that St.</hi> Columba <hi>was oblig'd to appear before him, to challenge a certain Free-man who had been made Captive; and when the Cauſe being plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the King, an unjuſt Sentence had been pronounc'd by him; the man of God roſe up with great indignation, and before all there preſent, told the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous King,</hi> That from that moment, he ſhould never ſee his face more, 'till God the juſt judge ſhall have diminiſh'd his Kingdom for his Injuſtice; for (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) as thou haſt deſpis'd me here before thy Nobles by an unjuſt Judgment, ſo ſhall the Eternal God deſpiſe thee, before thine enemies in the day of War. <hi>And having ſaid thus, he preſently took Horſe, ſmiting him with his Whip, ſo as the Blood iſſu'd from him: This being obſerv'd by the Kings Councellors preſent, they wonder'd at it, and humbly entreated the King to comply with the Holy mans requeſt, leaſt God ſhould diſſipate his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom according to the man of Gods threatning: But the King fill'd with fury would not underſtand, that he might do right; but ſwore, he would take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the Kingdred of St.</hi> Columba, <hi>and make them all ſlaves. And in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of his Oath, he gather'd a mighty Army,</hi> 23000 <hi>of Horſe, Foot and Charriots, and with it march'd to the Confines of that Country whither St.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumba <hi>went; with reſolution utterly to extirpate the Inhabitants: When therefore the People of</hi> Conal <hi>heard of the Kings coming, they likewiſe aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the number of</hi> 3000. <hi>reſolving to Fight manfully in defence of their Country, being in ſo great danger, and placing all their hope in God alone. St.</hi> Columba <hi>roſe very early, and being full of Gods Spirit, encourag'd them, and with a loud voice, which ſounded terribly through the whole Army, he ſaid to them,</hi> Fear nothing, God himſelf ſhall Fight for you, as he did with <hi>Moſes</hi> againſt the <hi>Egiptians</hi> at the red Sea; not any of you ſhall ſuffer the leaſt harm, for our Lords wrath is inflam'd, againſt the proud Kings Army: So that if one only perſon ſhall in the Name of God, give the Aſſault, He alone by the Power of God, ſhall put them to ſlight. Be Courageous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not a man of you ſhall fall in this Combat. <hi>When he had ſpoken this, which his Army believ'd as an aſſurance from Heaven; a few of his Soldiers, the ſame moment with wonderful Courage, ruſh'd upon their Enemies, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected them not: And at the ſame time, an Angel of God arm'd like a Soldier, and in the ſhape of a man, of an incredible high Stature, appear'd in the Kings Camp: His Aſpect was ſo terrible, that the Soldiers Hearts utterly fail'd them, and inſtead of reſiſting their Enemies, fell one upon another, in haſt to fly away; and ſuch a confuſion there was of Chariots and Horſes, that they kill'd one another: So that a handful of men, without any loſs, defeated a great Army, taking many Priſoners.</hi> After this wonderful victory, the man of God addreſs'd his Speech to a young-man nam'd <hi>Scandalan,</hi> with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick voice, ſaying, <hi>My Son, this day will procure for me a tedious Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, in a ſtrange Country, where I muſt live from my Friends many years; but ſay nothing of what I tell thee, 'till the event ſhew the truth of my words.</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:96414:87"/>After this St. <hi>Columba</hi> went to St. <hi>Finian,</hi> or St. <hi>Findbar,</hi> a Biſhop to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive condign Pennance from him becauſe of ſo much Bloodſhed in the ſaid War; and it is ſaid an Angel of God went with him, ſhining with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful brightneſs, but was viſible to none but St. <hi>Finian:</hi> The Pennance enjoyn'd by this Holy Biſhop to St. <hi>Columba</hi> was, <hi>That by Preaching and Example, he ſhould bring as many Souls to Heaven, as by occaſion of that War, were ſunk to Hell:</hi> After which Sentence, St. <hi>Columba</hi> with great joy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, <hi>That the judgement pronounc'd againſt him was equal and juſt:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this Holy mans Troubles did not end thus, for he was cenſur'd in a Synod of Biſhops, to abſtain from the Communion, though not without the diſſent of many in it; inſomuch as great contentions and diſputes aroſe among the Clergy; for the compoſing whereof, St. <hi>Columba</hi> himſelf ſent a Letter to St. <hi>Gildas.</hi> St. <hi>Columba</hi> wearied with theſe Eccleſiaſtical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, reſolv'd to quit his Native Country; but not permitted to chooſe his place of Exile, he by a Meſſenger conſulted the Holy man St. <hi>Brendan</hi> Abbot of <hi>Birre,</hi> to whom God had given the Spirit of Councel and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: who after he had lifted his Eyes and Heart to Heaven, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to dig under the feet of the Meſſenger, where was found a ſtone, on which was Engraven only the letter <hi>I,</hi> whereupon he bad the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to tell his Maſter, <hi>That he muſt go to an Iſland call'd</hi> J <hi>or</hi> Hy, <hi>where he ſhould find employment for his Zeal, and be the cauſe of bringing many Souls to Heaven.</hi> But <hi>Hector Boetius</hi> aſſignes another cauſe of his going into that Country, ſaying, <hi>The fame of the great Devotion and Piety of</hi> Conal <hi>King of the</hi> Picts <hi>drew St.</hi> Columba <hi>out of</hi> Ireland <hi>into</hi> Britain, <hi>attended with a multitude of his Diſciples, where he became the Father and Director of many Monaſteries.</hi> This Iſland falſly nam'd in ſome Copies, was at laſt call'd <hi>Iona:</hi> In ſome Copies alſo this St. <hi>Columba</hi> is confounded with that St. <hi>Columbanus,</hi> who being alſo an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man, founded ſeveral Monaſteries in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> by the <hi>Britains</hi> St. <hi>Columba</hi> is uſually call'd St. <hi>Columkill,</hi> for the great number of Cells, which he built in <hi>Britain.</hi> The Author of his Life, after he had extoll'd him for many Virtues and Auſterities, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates a Prophecy of him to this effect, <hi>That a certain Diſciple of St.</hi> Patrick <hi>nam'd</hi> Macceus, <hi>foretold of him, that in latter times ſhould be born one call'd</hi> Columba, <hi>who ſhould illuſtrate the Age wherein he ſhould live, and be highly favour'd of God: He ſhould deſcend from Noble Parents, and in the</hi> 45th. <hi>year of his Age ſhould paſs over out of</hi> Ireland <hi>into</hi> Britain, <hi>where he ſhould live a Stranger in Exile for Chriſt.</hi> S. <hi>Bede</hi> relates, <hi>That in the</hi> 565. <hi>year of our Lord, when</hi> Juſtinus <hi>the Son of</hi> Juſtinian <hi>govern'd the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire, there came out of</hi> Ireland <hi>a certain Prieſt and Abbot call'd</hi> Columba, <hi>with an intention to Preach the word of God to the</hi> Northern Picts, <hi>whoare ſeparated from the</hi> Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern <hi>Region by vaſt and horrible Mountains.</hi> For as for the <hi>Picts</hi> dwelling on the <hi>South</hi> of thoſe Mountains, they had many years before renounced their Idolatry, and embrac'd the Chriſtian Faith, as their Tradition is, by the Preaching of <hi>Nynias,</hi> a moſt Reverend and Holy Biſhop born in <hi>Britain,</hi> who had been Regularly inſtructed in the Miſteries of Divine Truth at <hi>Rome:</hi> The ſeat of whoſe Biſhoprick dignified with a Church Dedicated to St. <hi>Martin,</hi> where the ſaid Holy Biſhop with many other Saints doth reſt, is now in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Angli:</hi> The place pertaining to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the <hi>Bernicians,</hi> is ordinarily call'd <hi>Candida Caſa,</hi> or <hi>White-Houſe,</hi> becauſe a Church was there built of <hi>Hewn-ſtone,</hi> a way of Building not practic'd by the <hi>Britains.</hi>

Among all which, notwithſtanding the Monaſtery of <hi>Hy,</hi> in which his Sacred Body reſided, had the Preheminence and chief Authority: Now the ſaid Iſland is uſually govern'd by an Abbot who is a Prieſt, to whoſe Juriſdiction the whole Province, and even Biſhops themſelves, by a cuſtom no where elſe practic'd, ought to be ſubject according to the example of their firſt Teacher S <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> who was only a Prieſt and Monk, and no Biſhop: Of whoſe Life and Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, many ſtrange things are extant, compil'd by his Diſciples, but what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of man ſoever he was, ſure we are he left Succeſſors famous for their great Continency, Divine Love, and Regular Inſtitution: The Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to St. <hi>Columba,</hi> are ſaid to be twelve, who came with him into <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bion,</hi> eminently indu'd with the Doctrine of Chriſt, and adorn'd with great Sanctity; their Names were <hi>Bathemius</hi> and <hi>Cominus,</hi> afterwards Superiours over Monaſteries, and no mean Ornaments of the Chriſtian Church among the <hi>Scots:</hi> Alſo <hi>Cibthacus</hi> and <hi>Ethernau</hi> Nephews to St. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumba</hi> and Prieſts: Moreover <hi>Domitius, Rutius</hi> and <hi>Fethuo,</hi> men Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for their Deſcent, but more for their Piety: Laſtly, <hi>Scandalaus, Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodeus, Totaueus, Moteſer</hi> and <hi>Gallan:</hi> Theſe men after Travell'd through the Region of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Pict,</hi> and by their labour in Teaching, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting and Writing, imbu'd both thoſe Nations with virtuous Manners and true Religion. The <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Writers add one Companion more to St. <hi>Columba;</hi> namely St. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> formerly King of the <hi>Britains,</hi> who repenting his Crimes ſharply reprov'd by <hi>Gildas,</hi> became a Monk, and went with St. <hi>Columba</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he Preach'd the Faith to the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts:</hi> He built a Monaſtery in <hi>Govane</hi> near the River <hi>Cluid,</hi> which he govern'd as Abbot: He is ſaid to have Converted to the Faith the whole Province of <hi>Kentire,</hi> where he likewiſe dy'd a Martyr, and was buried in his Monaſtery in <hi>Govan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King who beſtow'd the Iſle of <hi>Hy</hi> upon St. <hi>Columba,</hi> and by the eminence of his Piety drew him thither, is ſaid to be St. <hi>Comgal</hi> or <hi>Conval</hi> King of <hi>Dalrieda.</hi> At the ſame time, not far from St. <hi>Columba,</hi> liv'd St. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigern,</hi> lately return'd to his Biſhoprick of <hi>Glaſco;</hi> to whom no doubt St. <hi>Columba</hi> was an Officious aſſiſtant in his Apoſtolick Office. Of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn meeting of theſe two Saints, with their Diſciples, we have already ſpoken: That there was a perfect agreement between theſe two Saints and their Diſciples, is no doubt, and between them and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in one Rite or Ceremony, about the time of keeping <hi>Eaſter:</hi> Upon which inconſiderable difference, ſome would infer that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches received their Faith from the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches, and not from <hi>Rome:</hi> St. <hi>Columba</hi> having ſpent more then 30 years, in this Place and Service, he impatiently beg'd of God to end his Pilgrimage; after his
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96414:88"/>Prayer ended, he ſaw in a Viſion, certain Angels approaching to him, to conduct his Soul to Heaven, which ſight was ſo joyful to him, that his Diſciples took notice of it: But this ſight was ſoon turn'd into ſorrow, for the Angels told him, <hi>That upon the Prayers of the</hi> Pictiſh <hi>Churches, God had added four years more to his Life:</hi> At laſt in the year of Grace 597. the ſame year St. <hi>Anguſtine</hi> came into <hi>Britain,</hi> this Holy man dy'd, and his Holy body was buried in the Monaſtery of <hi>Hy,</hi> from whence it was after tranſlated, or a great part of it into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and repos'd in the Church of <hi>Dun-Patrick,</hi> by an Inſcription on his Monument it is ſignified, <hi>That in that one Tomb three Saints, St.</hi> Patrick, <hi>St.</hi> Bridget <hi>and St.</hi> Columba <hi>did repoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto the <hi>Saxon</hi> Princes had imploy'd their Forces to the deſtruction of the <hi>Britains,</hi> but now finding little reſiſtance from them, turn'd their Arms againſt one another: For three years after the coming of St. <hi>Columba</hi> into <hi>Britain, Ceaulin</hi> and <hi>Cutha</hi> mov'd a Civil war againſt <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> which <hi>Ethelbert</hi> the rather enter'd into, becauſe the Power of <hi>Ceaulin</hi> ſo much increas'd, that he took upon him the Title of Monarch: Hereupon <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> a Valiant Young Prince, mindful of the Glory of his Anceſtors, who had always enjoy'd a Preheminence above other Princes, reſolv'd to keep it: And raiſing an Army, march'd with it into the Province of the <hi>Regni</hi> or <hi>Surry;</hi> where paſſing unwarily over a little River call'd <hi>Wandalis,</hi> he was rudely repuls'd by <hi>Ceaulin;</hi> but endeavouring again to march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the Armies met at a Village call'd <hi>Wibbandun,</hi> now <hi>Wimbledon,</hi> where he was with a great ſlaughter of his men compell'd to fly back into <hi>Kent,</hi> having loſt his two chief Captains <hi>Oſlaf</hi> and <hi>Kneban:</hi> Where this Battle was fought, ſtill remains as a Monument of it, a Rampire rais'd in a round form, as encompaſſing a Camp, call'd <hi>Knebensbury: Ethelbert</hi> after his loſs, ſought to ſtrengthen himſelf by a Friendſhip and Confederacy with the Neighbouring Powerful Kingdom of the <hi>Franks;</hi> to make which Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy more laſting, he deſir'd to confirm it by Marriage, which he effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: This Kingdom heretofore was call'd <hi>Gaul,</hi> but afterwards the <hi>Franks,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Nation under their King <hi>Pharamond</hi> invading it, and poſſeſſing the greateſt part of it, chang'd the Name from <hi>Gaul</hi> to <hi>France:</hi> The Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of <hi>Pharamond</hi> for ſeveral Generations were <hi>Pagans,</hi> till by St. <hi>Remi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rhemes</hi> in the year of Grace 499. King <hi>Clodoveus</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Chriſtian Faith, and with him the greateſt part of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which Faith ever after continu'd and encreas'd there: This King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Franks</hi> was at that time govern'd by four Kings Sons of <hi>Clotha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi> a Daughter of one of which Kings <hi>Elthelbert</hi> Married, nam'd <hi>Berta, Gregory</hi> calls her <hi>Aldiberga,</hi> to whom he attributes the Converſion of the the <hi>Saxons:</hi> Her Parents, not without ſome difficulty, deliver'd their Chriſtian Daughter to the Bed of a <hi>Pagan,</hi> but had an engagement from <hi>Ethelbert</hi> to allow Her and her Family an entire freedom in Religion; and ſo the Marriage was concluded. The Lady was accompanied into <hi>Britain</hi> by a Prudent and Devout Biſhop, call'd <hi>Lethardus,</hi> who is Styl'd, <hi>The Percurſor to St.</hi> Auguſtine, and one who open'd the door to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity here: There were then in <hi>Doroberni</hi> or <hi>Canterbury</hi> ſeveral Churches, which had been built by Chriſtians many Ages before, in the times of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and were not utterly demoliſh'd by the <hi>Saxons;</hi> amongſt which the Queen made choice of that which had been Dedicated to the Honour of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> and ſtood <hi>Eaſtward</hi> of the City: The Author of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96414:89"/>Life of this Biſhop <hi>Lethardus,</hi> tells us, what Devotions this Queen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in this Church, <hi>viz. That ſhe and her Family frequented the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of</hi> Maſſes <hi>and</hi> Prayers, <hi>in the Celebrating whereof, the Bleſſed Biſhop</hi> Lethardus <hi>was Preſident, or chief Prieſt:</hi> The ſaying or ſinging of <hi>Maſſes,</hi> were the Solemn Devotion of the Church in thoſe times, as appears by the Councels of <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Tours</hi> Celebrated in theſe very times; inſomuch as St. <hi>Columba</hi> by Revelation, knowing the death of St. <hi>Brendan</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Celebrated a Solemn Maſs for his Soul.</p>
            <p>In the year of Grace 571. <hi>Cuthulf</hi> the Brother of King <hi>Ceaulin</hi> fought with the <hi>Britains</hi> at <hi>Bedanford</hi> now <hi>Bedford;</hi> and having obtain'd the Victory, he took from them four Royal Cities, <hi>Linganburgh,</hi> a place now unknown, <hi>Egelsburgh</hi> now <hi>Ailesburgh</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire; Benſingtun</hi> or <hi>Benſon</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> and alſo <hi>Egneſham</hi> now unknown: After which Victory <hi>Cuthulf</hi> departed this life. In the year 575. the Kingdom of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles</hi> was Erected, in <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeſhire</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Ely;</hi> the Name of the firſt King was <hi>Offa,</hi> from whom his Succeſſors and Subjects were call'd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ffings:</hi> Some place Kings in this Region be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Offa</hi>'s time; if ſuch were, they ſeem to be Dependant and upon Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, as after they were again <hi>Beneficiarii</hi> ſometimes of the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Kings, ſometimes of the <hi>Mercians:</hi> Two years after the beginning of <hi>Offa</hi>'s reign, was fought a Battle fatal to the <hi>Britains,</hi> by which they were expell'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of all the fertile Plains of this Iſland, and driven to the Mountains of <hi>Wales.</hi> The <hi>Britains</hi> had hitherto defended themſelves in their Cities of <hi>Gloceſter, Cirenceſter</hi> and <hi>Bath;</hi> but this year <hi>Ceaulin</hi> after an overthrow given in Battle, expugn'd thoſe three Cities and forc'd the <hi>Britains</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into mountains and Woods: <hi>This Battle</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cambden</hi>) <hi>was fought at a place call'd</hi> Deorham, <hi>after which the City of</hi> Bath <hi>was given up to the</hi> Saxons; And in this Battle, it is ſaid, three Chriſtian Kings of the <hi>Britains</hi> were ſlain, whoſe Names were <hi>Comagil, Candigan</hi> and <hi>Faringmagil,</hi> ſo that <hi>Ceaulin</hi> became ſo terrible to the <hi>Britains,</hi> that all places haſt'ned to render themſelves to their Power: Nevertheleſs the <hi>Britains</hi> after ſeven years reſt, again attempted another Combat with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> at a place call'd <hi>Fedhanlea,</hi> where on both ſides they fought with horrible fury: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as <hi>Cuthwin</hi> the Son of <hi>Ceaulin</hi> being oppreſs'd with multitudes, was ſlain: But <hi>Ceaulin</hi> having repair'd his Army, the Soldiers whereof bound themſelves by Oath not to fly, at laſt in Battle vanquiſh'd the Conquering <hi>Britains,</hi> and purſuing them, too many Provinces and innumerable Spoils.</p>
            <p>In the year of Grace 585. the Kingdom of the <hi>Mercians</hi> took beginning under their firſt King <hi>Croeda</hi> or <hi>Crida,</hi> though its foundation might be laid ſooner: This <hi>Crida</hi> reckon'd himſelf the tenth in Deſcent from <hi>Woden</hi> the Idol Diety of the <hi>Saxons:</hi> And whereas the others poſſeſs'd themſelves of the outward parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> this <hi>Crida</hi> peirc'd into the Bowels of it, by little and little poſſeſſing himſelf of all the Provinces towards the <hi>North,</hi> confin'd with the Rivers <hi>Humber</hi> and <hi>Merſey,</hi> on the <hi>South</hi> with the <hi>Thames,</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> with <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Deva,</hi> on the <hi>Weſt</hi> with the <hi>German</hi> Ocean: The <hi>Britains</hi> themſelves by a voluntary Ceſſion made <hi>Crida</hi>'s way very eaſie to his new erected Throne, in which he as yet ſat contented with the inferiour title of Governour or Duke: For the <hi>Saxons</hi> being now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd through all the parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> and every day gaining more ſtrength, became intollerably burdenſom to the poor <hi>Britains;</hi> and being Infidels, publiſh'd Laws extreamly prejudicial to Chriſtian Religion:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96414:89"/>Whereupon by agreement between the Clergy and other <hi>Britiſh</hi> Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, hitherto mixt with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> they reſolv'd to quit the Country, and to retire, ſome to the Mountains of <hi>Wales,</hi> ſome into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> others to <hi>Little Britain</hi> and other Chriſtian Regions: Then it was, to wit, in the year of our Lord 586. that the Arch-Prelates <hi>Theonus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Thadioc</hi> or <hi>Theodoc</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> ſeeing all their Churches levell'd with the ground, attended with many Eccleſiaſticks, ſled into <hi>Wales,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with them the Sacred Relicks of Saints, leaſt by an irruption of the Barbarous <hi>Saxons,</hi> the Sacred Bones of ſo many and ſo great Saints, ſhould be deſtroy'd. So that the Provinces of <hi>Loegria</hi> and <hi>Northumbria</hi> were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly depriv'd of Chriſtian Congregations: Upon the Bodies of ſome Saints reverently hid in Monuments, great heaps of Earth were caſt, leaſt they ſhould be obnoxious to the contumelious ſcorn of <hi>Inſidels;</hi> for the Kings of the <hi>Angli</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> as they were very Powerful in Arms, ſo were they malicious <hi>Pagans,</hi> thirſting after nothing more then the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of Chriſt, and the Subverſion of his Worſhip, where-ever they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd a Country, if any Church were left untouch'd they turn'd it into a Temple of their Profane Idols; with their Impious Sacrifices polluting the Altars of the true God.</p>
            <p>Concerning this <hi>Theonus</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> he was formerly Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and from thence tranſlated to <hi>London</hi> in the year 553. and in the year 586. with his whole Clergy fled, as is ſaid, into his own Country. Afterwards the Metropolitical Dignity was transfer'd to <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> as ſhall hereafter be declar'd. And never after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of <hi>Theodoc,</hi> do we read of any other Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> 'till by the Converſion of <hi>Edwin</hi> Son of <hi>Alla</hi> King of the <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> St. <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> was there Conſecrated Arch-biſhop: By the Seceſſion and flight of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Clergy and other Inhabitants, there remain'd the miſerable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of the <hi>Britains</hi> in three Provinces only, namely, in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> ſtretching forth it ſelf like a Horn into the Sea, in <hi>South-Wales</hi> and <hi>North-wales;</hi> with theſe narrow limits they were forced to be content; nevertheleſs they never departed from the true Faith of Chriſt: One thing there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for which they are juſtly to be reprehended, the mortal hatred which they long did bear to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation who expell'd them, was ſo, as they would leſs communicate with them, then with Dogs: So miſtaken are they which will needs think, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> were inſtructed in Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the <hi>Britains,</hi> and not by St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> from <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Saxons</hi> were no ſooner in a ſecure Poſſeſſion of this Iſland, but Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, ſo diſpos'd the effects of his Divine Providence, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way of their Converſion to him, in order to their eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; as if an earthly Kingdom, had not been a reward anſwerable to their merits in deſtroying an ungrateful People, abandon'd to all Impiety. The inſtrument of this Felicity now approaching, was the Bleſſed man St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> then a private Prieſt, though ſoon after a moſt worthy Succeſſor of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Apoſtolick Chair at <hi>Rome:</hi> Upon this Happy occaſion, a number of young <hi>Engliſh</hi> Youths were brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there expos'd to the publick Market to be Sold; <hi>Gregory</hi> excited by a zealous Affection to propagate the Name of Chriſt, and mov'd with a tender compaſſion towards thoſe Children, with whoſe Beautiful Features and amiableneſs he was affected; and underſtanding that the Nation from whence they came, was deſtitute of the knowledge of Chriſt, took a reſolution to ſow
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96414:90"/>amongſt them, the Divine Seed of Chriſtian Faith: And being after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to the Pontificate, in order to the effecting of his deſign, ſent St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> the Monk, to lay the foundation of a Chriſtian Church in this Iſland, joyning with him other Auxiliaries and Devout Companions of his Labours: Biſhop <hi>Parker</hi> ſeems to doubt this Story, becauſe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability that the <hi>Saxons</hi> ſhould Sell their Children; whereas <hi>Tacitus</hi> recounting the Manners of the Antient <hi>Germans;</hi> affirms, <hi>They would out of greedineſs of gaining in Dice playing, even ſet their own liberty at ſtake:</hi> And <hi>Malmburienſis</hi> ſays, <hi>It was a familiar and almoſt a natural inbred cuſtom among them to ſell their Children; which unhappy cuſtom continu'd many Ages in our Nation:</hi> Inſomuch, as in the days of our King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, by the Teſtimony of <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis, A Synod at</hi> Armagh <hi>in</hi> Ireland, <hi>was fain to make a Decree, for redeeming of ſuch</hi> Engliſh <hi>Youths as had been ſold for ſlaves in that Iſland:</hi> And before that time, among the Laws of <hi>Inas</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons,</hi> there is more then one Decree which under great Penalties, forbid this unnatural Traffique.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, St. <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf in his Epiſtle to <hi>Candidus</hi> his Procurator in <hi>France,</hi> gives him order, <hi>To redeem ſuch</hi> Engliſh <hi>Children, as he met with ſold for Slaves in that Kingdom, and to ſend them to</hi> Rome, <hi>to be there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Chriſtian Faith:</hi> In truth, almoſt all Antient Writers agree in the ſtory, though ſome differ about the time, ſome aſcribing it to the time of <hi>Pope Benedict,</hi> but moſt, and that moſt truly, to the latter end of <hi>Pope Pelagius</hi> St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s immediate Predeceſſor: St. <hi>Beda</hi> thus delivers the true Circumſtances of this Story, and tells us, <hi>That by Tradition from their Anceſtors it was brought to them, that St.</hi> Gregory <hi>took ſo much care for the Salvation of our Nation; that on a day when great variety of Merchandize was brought into the Market at</hi> Rome <hi>by Foreign Merchants; St.</hi> Gregory <hi>eſpecially took notice of three young Children of a pure Complexion, Beautiful looks, and Hairs Gracefully order'd, and enquir'd out of what Country they came; and being told, they came from the Iſland of</hi> Britain, <hi>where the Inhabitants generally are ſo Comely; ask'd whether they were</hi> Chriſtians <hi>or</hi> Pagans, <hi>and being told they were</hi> Pagans, <hi>Sigh'd, ſaying,</hi> Alas! what pitty is it, that the Prince of Darkneſs ſhould poſſeſs men of ſuch bright Countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and that perſons ſo amiable in their Looks, ſhould have Souls devoid of inward Grace: <hi>Then he ask'd what was the Name of their particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to whom was anſwered, That they were call'd</hi> Angli, Well may they be ſo call'd <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> for they have Angelick Countenances ſuitable to ſuch who ſhall be Co-heirs with Angels. <hi>He further ask'd how the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince is call'd from whence they came, the Anſwer was, that they were Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Province call'd</hi> Deiri, <hi>ſaid he, importing they ſhould be deliver'd from the Ire of God,</hi> (de ira dei eruti,) <hi>and call'd to partake of his Mercy: His laſt queſtion was,</hi> How the King of that Nation was call'd, <hi>and being told</hi> Alle, <hi>in alluſion to that name, he preſently reply'd,</hi> Allelujah muſt be Sung in thoſe parts to the Praiſe of God who created all things: <hi>After which Diſcourſe he went to</hi> Pelagius <hi>then Biſhop of the</hi> Roman <hi>and Apoſtolick See (himſelf not being then</hi> Pope) <hi>and humbly intreated him to ſend into</hi> Britain <hi>ſome Miniſters of Gods word to Convert that Nation to Chriſt; adding,</hi> That he himſelf was ready to be employ'd with Gods aſſiſtance in ſuch a work, if his Holineſs thought fit: <hi>But his offer could not be taken, for the</hi> Romans <hi>would not permit his Abſence ſo far from the City.</hi> Notwithſtanding a while after, when hewas exalted to the <hi>Popedom,</hi> he brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

            <p>St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in the third year after he was <hi>Pope,</hi> by his Wiſdom and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority reſtor'd the Churches of <hi>Ireland</hi> to Catholick Unity, from which they had been ſeparated, by a quarrel about the <hi>tria Capitula</hi> ſpoken of before: His Epiſtle unto them concerning that ſubject is extant, by which they received full ſatisfaction: For preſently after, ſeveral of their Biſhops, and other Devout perſons, undertook Pilgrimages to <hi>Rome,</hi> to expreſs their Duty to the Supreme Biſhop.

            <p>It is agreed on all hands, that this Day-Star of Chriſtianity, began to ſhine among the <hi>Saxons</hi> in the year of Grace 590. for then the Apoſtolick Meſſengers from <hi>Rome</hi> receiv'd their Miſſion from the moſt worthy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of St. <hi>Peter</hi> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, in the ſeventh year of his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, and began their Journey toward our Iſland, though they did not arrive here 'till the year following: At this time the <hi>Saxon</hi> Heptarchy was eſtabliſh'd in <hi>Britain,</hi> and all the Provinces thereof were entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of the <hi>Angli</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> except the <hi>Northern</hi> Kingdom of the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots;</hi> the <hi>Weſtern</hi> parts in <hi>Cambria</hi> and <hi>Cornwall</hi> were not yet wholly ſubdu'd by the <hi>Saxons:</hi> The Kings governing the Heptarchy, their Names and Provinces are as follows, <hi>Ethelbert</hi> was then in the 35th. year of his reign; He was the Son of <hi>Irmeric,</hi> Son of <hi>Otha,</hi> Son of <hi>Eſka,</hi> Son of <hi>Hengist,</hi> this Kingdom contain'd <hi>Kent</hi> as now bounded: Next over the <hi>South-Saxons;</hi> which Kingdom compriz'd <hi>Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> reign'd <hi>Eldwalch</hi> the Son of <hi>Ciſſa,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ella,</hi> who firſt eſtabliſh'd this Kingdom; this was the ſeventh year of <hi>Eldwalch</hi> his reign: Thirdly, the King of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons</hi> under <hi>Celric</hi> in his firſt year, as Nephew to <hi>Ceaulin,</hi> who founded this Kingdom in the year of Grace 519. within his Dominions were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended <hi>Hampſhire, Barkſhire, Wiltſhire, Somerſetſhire, Dorſetſhire, Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> and part of <hi>Cornwal:</hi> Next over the <hi>Eaſt-Saxons, Sebert</hi> was in the firſt year of his reign, he was the Son of <hi>Sledda</hi> Son of <hi>Erkenwin;</hi> who in the year of Grace 527. eſtabliſh'd that Kingdom, containing <hi>Eſſex, Middleſex,</hi> and ſo much of <hi>Hartfordſhire</hi> as is under the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Juriſdiction, whoſe Dioceſs is Adequate to that Kingdom: After this was the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> to which belongeth whatever lyeth between <hi>Humber</hi> and <hi>Edenburgh:</hi> It was ſometime divided into two Kingdoms of <hi>Bernicia</hi> and <hi>Deiri; Bernicia</hi> contain'd <hi>Northumberland</hi> with the <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Edenburgh:</hi> The <hi>Deiri</hi> conſiſted of part of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> with the entire Counties of <hi>York, Durham, Weſtmerland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland:</hi> The whole Kingdom at this time was govern'd by <hi>Ethelfrid</hi> in the fourth year of his reign; who was the Son of <hi>Alla</hi> Son of <hi>Ida,</hi> who founded that Kingdom in the year of Grace 547.
